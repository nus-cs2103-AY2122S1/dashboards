The gradle build test for ubuntu detect a error for bR (not sure why). Also for the `new BufferedReader(  new InputStreamReader(is));`, they throw error for having a space between the '(' and "new"

 I think the while need to have a space after it as indicated by the error. But it seem weird to have a space between there. Can try adding a space to see if the error will be solve?

Maybe we could throw this line to the ui class and call the function. I think we might reuse the function quite often

@lowyanshuang I think there's some indentation and syntax error on your Duke.java Line 24,35 - 40. Can check and update here before I merge to the main repo?

@lowyanshuang @AY2122S1-TIC4001-F18-5/developers 

In the future, please create a branch and do PR on the new branch that you've implemented. For this case, you have PR into the master branch, which is not recommended. However, I will still merge it into the master branch for this time round.

On a side note, good job on creating a new "Message" class.

might be cleaner to create a method in Module that returns this formatted string you need. then, you can just call this new method here

also maybe rename printApiModules to printApiModule maybe, looks like this method is printing one module rather than a bunch of modules

## NOTE

- [ ] above move still old way of working, suppose to be new Set Cmd 

	

- [ ] now no cmd to move a task under a proj, so I wrote demo print out under the last method of NextTest: testListPrint(), kindly see the print on screen and understand how gtdThought `.getRec(Stat)` method work. 

	

- [ ] rmb now we have 2 lists, `master` and `current`: `master` keeps a copy of all lv0 gtdThoughts (may or may not be proj), `current` will be _rewritten every time ListCommand is called_. so you should be clear on when to use which list, **mostly likely** should be `current` list, which user refers to and provide indexes
