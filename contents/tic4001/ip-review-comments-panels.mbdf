How do you think a static property to store the `totalNumOfTask`?
not sure if java properties can be computed properties, so that I hope to give each task a unique but dynamically changing `taskNo` property ü§î 
now my `taskNo` is initiated by `= totalNumOfTask`, but it works only because there is no delete task function in Duke 

also thinking about if the `totalNumOfTask` can be more dynamically mutated to be `totalNumOfUndoneTask` which is more useful

I believe the line.contains(command) method cannot tell where the command begins in the user input string? If input string has "done" in it and the line.charAt(0) == 'd' is true, yet the first word can be e.g. "ddt"? The line logic seems not clear here?

```
public static void addSpaces(String text, Integer value) {
        System.out.printf((text) + "%n", " ".repeat(value));
    }

Oh, yes I was initially thrown off by the above addSpaces() code with the brackets (text) - so the numbers appear cryptic to me, but I look at the above code usage line 27 - 30 I see now how it is supposed to work.
Kindly disregard my previous comment, thank you!

Since we are using split(" ") string method to split up the words delimited by spaces, it will naturally remove spaces from each of the elements returned.

```
String wordOne = "Hello World"
String[] splitWords = wordOne.split(" ")
// splitWords[0] == "Hello" and splitWords[1] == "World"

// In the case of multiple spaces (e.g. double spaces)
String wordTwo = "Hello  World"
splitWords = wordTwo.split(" ")
// splitWords[0] == "Hello"
// splitWords[1] == " "
// splitWords[2] == "World"
```

The trim() method removes whitespace from both ends of a string and since split handled that for you, you can save some extra steps here.
