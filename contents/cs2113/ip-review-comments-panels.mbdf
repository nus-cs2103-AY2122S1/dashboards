Overall, the code is fairly decent to follow. One general comment is that a lot of the methods can be extracted out to make it easier for somebody else to follow quickly. Single line if loops and for loops should still follow the format of:
if (CONDITION) {
    // write code here
}
Consider using descriptive names for variables (exp: instead of str or str2, use errorMessage or helpMessage)

The reuse of the str String variable may be non-intuitive - it initially refers to the command input by the user, and after re-assignment, it became the message back to the user. Consider using separate String names such as userCommand and returnMessage. Otherwise, just parse "not assigned yet" into printString()

Perhaps it will be cleaner to override the `.toString()` method to return the entire `[T][ ] task name` string, instead of needing separate public `getLetter()` and `getStatusIcon()` methods.

```
public String toString() {
    String checkbox = isCompleted ? "[X]" : "[ ]";
    return checkbox + " " + taskName;
}
```

It is also possible to further override the function in the subclasses. 
Example for Deadline subclass
```
@Override
public String toString() {
    String checkbox = isCompleted ? "[X]" : "[ ]";
    return "[D]" + super.toString() + " " + "(by: " + by + ")";

Linked to the comment on overriding the `.toString()` method in `Task`. By doing so, this part of code can be simplified to

System.out.println( itemNum + "." + list[itemNum - 1])

It might be cleaner to refactor this into a separate method. 
One way is to have additional methods in the Duke class that handles the different Task subclasses. 
Another is to create a separate class `TaskManager` that stores the array of Tasks and has functions to add the different Task subclasses to keep the main Duke class clean. __(I think this will be the best approach)__
Another is to overload the subclass constructors to take in `String[]` or a similar data structure.

As mentioned above, the style of coding should be consistent where earlier u initialised a string first before printing out greetings but here u print the text out instantly so maybe itll be more consistent if u stuck to one style!

I think the case statements are indented wrongly. It should be the same level of indentation as the switch statement.

switch (condition) {
case ABC:
    statements;
    // Fallthrough
case DEF:
    statements;
    break;

I think your habit of documentation throughout is great and it helps readers understand the code much better.

Since there are so many if conditions, I think you can consider using switch statement to implement your code.

I think instead of using "magic numbers" as inputs to your substring method, you could utilize constants instead such as COMMAND_TODO_INDEX, which can help tell other people looking at your code that the number is supposed to capture the string input after each individual command (todo, events, etc)

Based on the instructions, you need to create 1 new class in Level-3 and 3 new inherited classes from Level-4. Using the string arrays to store multiple data makes the program look more complex and decreases the quality of the code. It's better to add comments to describe the purpose of some variables, in which the names of the variables do not exactly define what it stores.

It is better use another way to extract the command, since you create a array of String, but only use the first element.

Would it be better to reduce the size of this `while` block, as it is currently over 30 lines? It would be ideal to extract each of the commands (ie. `commandWord.equals("done")`) into its own function.

The code is generally clean of coding standard violations. However, you might want to relook the large number of constants that were declared and see if there is any other way to work around them. I would also recommend that you implement a TaskManager class to manage all your tasks.

For the starting index of the substring, you can consider using a named constant for each type of task, e.g TODO and derive the length of the string from there so that you can avoid "magic numbers" and it will also be easier for you if you choose to change the command name in the future.

Overall very neat code! I like how you introduced the TaskManager class. However, there is quite a lot of usage of "magic numbers" or "magic strings" so it would be good if you could extract them into named constants. This can help you make easy changes to the code in the future and avoid any unwanted errors from forgetting to change these numbers.

Good use of ternary conditions but I think you could split the { } or use if else here. It took me a while to understand what this line was doing :( You can also take out the 2 as a constant and name it something else because I am not too sure what 2 represents in this function.

Great work and the code was split into many smaller and easy-to-read functions! I think maybe some longer strings and variables can still be defined as a constant at the top of the class (ie. the logo or the bye message). Maybe header comments can be added to more functions to make us understand the code better. Good job overall 👍
