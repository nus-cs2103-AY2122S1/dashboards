A follow-up tip of this question https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2122S1/forum/issues/121.

The recommendation is to avoid wrapping Markdown lines at a specified length. So to make life easier, you can disable this feature on IntelliJ just for Markdown. Here are the steps:

1. If you're on Windows, navigate to `File > Settings > Code Style > Markdown > Wrapping and Braces`
Note: The layout on Mac might be slightly different
2. Set `Hard wrap at` to a high value (e.g., 999)
3. Set `Wrap on typing` to `No`
4. Apply

<panel  header="**5. :fas-info-circle: Better way to checking multiple `instanceof`**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2122S1/forum/issues/89" expanded>

Let's say I have a class `Animal` which will be the parent class of all animals (duh!). For example, consider the following code. 

```java
class Animal {
    // ...
}

class Parrot extends Animal {
    // ...

    int fly() {
        // ...
    }
}

class Eagle extends Animal {
    // ...

    int fly() {
        // ...
    }
}

class Bat extends Animal {
    // ...

    int fly() {
        // ...
    }
}

// ...etc
```

Note: The `fly` method returns the velocity of said animal while flying.

Now here comes the problem. Suppose I have a list of animals object `ListOfAnimals`, and I want to filter out every animal that can fly with a velocity of, say, more than a certain variable `v`. I can think of several ways to do this.

1. **Using multiple `if-else`**

```java
public List<Animal> filterAnimalByVelocity(int v) {
    List<Animal> filteredListOfAnimals = new ArrayList<>();

    for (Animal animal : ListOfAnimals) {
        if (animal instanceof Parrot) {
            Parrot parrot = (Parrot) animal;
            if (parrot.fly() > v) {
                filteredListOfAnimals.add(parrot);
            }
        } else if (animal instanceof Eagle) {
            // ...do something similar
        } else if (animal instanceof Bat) {
            // ...do something similar
        }
        // ...repeat else if for all other animals that can fly
    }

    return filteredListOfAnimals;
}
```

The above solution certainly works, but it is not scalable. When I add a new class of animal that can fly, I have to modify this function.

2. **Create a `Bird` class**

The rationale for doing this is to cast an instance to `Bird` whenever possible, so we can execute the `fly` method. However, my problem with this solution is that not every bird can fly, and that other animals that are not bird can also fly too (e.g. bat).

3. **Create a `Flyable` interface**

Every animal that can fly must implement this interface. So I just need to check if an animal object is a subclass of `Flyable`. This idea sounds great to me, but unfortunately it doesn't work.

```java
public List<Animal> filterAnimalByVelocity(int v) {
    List<Animal> filteredListOfAnimals = new ArrayList<>();

    for (Animal animal : ListOfAnimals) {
        if (animal instanceof Flyable) {
            Flyable flyingAnimal = (Flyable) animal;    // compile-time error
            if (flyingAnimal.fly() > v) {
                filteredListOfAnimals.add(flyingAnimal);
            }
        }
    }

    return filteredListOfAnimals;
}
```

So here is my question. Is there a better way of doing this, rather than just checking `instanceof` in multiple `if-else`?

I understand that static import allows us to pick certain static members from classes, without having to type the class qualifications. However, could this potentially harm the readability of our code? I'm wondering if it is just for syntactic sugar. Anyone have any thoughts on this?

Yes, &gt;code>System.out.println(scores.length);&gt;/code> prints 4, because you initialized &gt;code>scores&gt;/code> as an array of size 4. Java has 0-based indexing so an array of size 4 will start from index 0 to 3 (i.e. scores[0] until scores[3] is valid).

There seems to be two grouping methods adopted by most programmer, either grouping by functionality or scope/accessibility.

From what I can find..
* [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-fileorganization.html) seems to prefer grouping methods based on functionality rather than by scope/accessibility.
* [Robert C. Martin](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1760877) advises programmers to organize their member variables at the top of the class (constants first, then private members).
* Sun Microsystems' Java Coding Style Guide has very rigid organization. See [Section 6.1](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.443.7443&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

 Whichever one that you end up choosing, I think it is important to be consistent. Not sure if there is any specific requirement from this module though.

From what I can gather, `System.lineSeparator()` returns the system-dependent line separator string. Using it makes the code more portable, as shown by someone [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23707024). I guess the implementation is most apparent/useful when dealing with obscure non-standard OS? Which is why it was designed as a method instead.

One question though, is it a good practice to replace every `\n` with `System.lineSeparator()`? For example,

```java
// Is this ok?
String s = "Hello, World!\n";

// Or is this better?
String s = "Hello, World!" + System.lineSeparator();

I could do the same and then try out the suggested method, but I am just making sure this will not result in some kinda problem with the grading scripts. Should I push my repo to the remote as it is and then proceed?

Since you haven't pushed to GitHub yet, I think it is safer to try? Since it will only affect the git history on your local machine. I actually tried recreating the issue, and the suggested method seems to be working fine.

In case you cannot use Finnhub, you can take a look at alternative like [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) as it seems to support academic usage.

Sometimes we just want to focus on the main logic of the program and forget about exceptions. However, since Java uses checked exceptions, you are forced to deal with them, otherwise your code will not compile. However, doing this..

```java
try {
  // your code
} catch (Exception e) {
  // do nothing
}
```

is a horrible idea. Since `Exception` is the superclass of all exceptions, everything will get silently ignored! And it will be difficult to figure out later on if something is wrong with your code.

This practice is such a notoriously bad practice that there is a name for it -- [The Pokemon Exception Handling](https://wiki.c2.com/?PokemonExceptionHandling).

This is slightly better than swallowing all the exceptions. But by doing this, you are unable to handle them properly. For example, your code can catch both `FileNotFoundException` and `NullPointerException`, but you will probably want your program to react to them differently by using multiple `catch` blocks. Generally, the rule of thumb is to catch all the exceptions that you **expect**. So if you managed to catch something that you didn't expect, it is most definitely an indication that your code is buggy.

> When we see the method signature, we know what is thrown. The person using your class (or library) should know why it is being thrown.

Ah this makes sense. I think this relates back to the concept that a good documentation should explain the *what* and *why*, rather than the *how*, as explained [here](https://nus-cs2113-ay2122s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/codeQuality.html#explain-what-and-why-not-how).

I think you can handle it this way. For example, consider the following codes.

```java
BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("foo.in"));    // might throws FileNotFoundException
String data = input.readline();    // might throws IOException
while (data != null) {
    // ...do something with the data
    data = input.readline();    // might throws IOException
}
```

Since `IOException` and `FileNotFoundException` are checked exceptions, you are forced to handle them. We can rewrite the code to this.

```java
try {
    BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("foo.in"));    // might throws FileNotFoundException
    String data = input.readline();    // might throws IOException
    while (data != null) {
        // ...do something with the data
        data = input.readline();    // might throws IOException
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    // FileNotFoundException is a subclass of IOException (you might want to handle them separately)
    // ...do something here, maybe notify user or create a new file?
} finally {
    if (input != null) {
        input.close();    // don't forget to close the stream
    }
}
```

But wait, if you check the [official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/Reader.html#close()), `close()` can throw an `IOException` too! So you might want to rewrite the code to this.

```java
} finally {
    try {
        if (input != null) {
            input.close();    // might throws IOException
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        //...do something, or maybe ignore?
    }
}
```

Unfortunately, as you can see, after handling the exceptions our code now looks ugly, it is cluttered. Furthermore, we have to write this boilerplate code again and again for every `IOException` handling. So I don't think this is the best way to handle `IOException`, and surely there should be better alternatives out there. But this is currently what I can think of, hope this helps!

Interesting question. A static member is associated with a class, rather than an instance of the class. So I suppose the practice is just to make our code cleaner and not misleading? Not sure if there is any serious pitfalls.

Hi All,

I've been having some issues with Q3 in coursemo. It is the question where you have to print the area of the shape.

The answer being produced by my code seems to be 100% the same as the one in coursemo but it still shows my answer as wrong.

I've double checked to ensure that its not a compile error but to no avail. Did anyone encountered this issue or is it just me?

Hi Guys,

I think i know the issue. I believe it's mainly due to the formatting of my float output. When the total value is 0, it prints out as "0.0" when the system is expecting "0.00". This can easily be fixed by using `System.out.printf(...)` instead of using `System.out.println(...)`

FC gave me no difference in output. The only main difference i can find is that my actual output ends off at the next line cause i'm using `println(...)` to output. Aside from that, both the FC command and myself can't seem to spot any difference in the outputs.

> In this test case, there is a new line (\n) after the last print output (16), so using println() should be fine for producing the correct output. My suggestion is to check if you have too many new lines after the last print output (there should be only one \n). You may also want to check if there is extra space before or after each of your print outputs (in each line). As our friends mentioned above, these differences are hard to catch. The test case for this question checks strictly if your standard output matches the sample output, so one extra space will be considered "different".

I've double checked my output multiple times. (I've attached the output txt file below). I suspect it might be due to some compile error? But I'm not sure what might be causing it. The code in Coursemo is 100% the same as the code in my compiler.

I tried both `println(...)` and `print(... \n)`. none of them passed the test case.

A quick google said to use `System.lineSeperator()` as this will provide you with whatever the current system is using.

Hi all,

The issue has been resolve. The main issue was that Coursemo was searching for the function `area()` in my code but i had created another function called `getArea()` to perform the task of `area()`. As such, Coursemo treated as though my code was incorrect.

If such is the case, in the context of this module, is it still ok to continue to use `println` or do I have to change all `println` to `print(... + System.lineSeparator())`?

My solution to that was to use

```
try {
  // your code
} catch (Exception e) {
  print("Error :" + e)
}
```
As this would allow the user/me to still know what error is thrown. Or if need be, there is the `e.printStackTrace()` that would show which line it is at.

Since this does not change for a given platform, wouldn't it make sense to implement it as an immutable variable in the runtime, since Java is dynamically linked by nature, which implies that implementing it as a variable still preserves its ability to "write once, run everywhere"?

For command-line parameters, it is your shell rather than Java that split the parameters by whitespaces. Generally, you need to enclose arguments with whitespaces in quotes.

You don't have to redo everything, actually. You can branch out from your current HEAD, hard reset your master to wherever your previous work was, and merge as normal.

You can use `-f` option of `git tag` to force the tag to be moved.

To add on to the discussion above, you can rewrite your repository as you wish even if you have already pushed to the remote. You may need to use `-f` when pushing and it is generally bad practice, but it is possible and should not interfere with the grading script.

Prof will the auto grader only grade the commits that we've tagged appropriately. For example, I pushed a commit tagged Level-1 with code showing the echo function working properly. Later I push another commit tagged Level-2 with ONLY the add and list function working. 

Or do I have to show both level 1 and 2 functions working together when I push the level 2 code? Because that will take a bit more time to make sure they integrate and work properly.

Understood sir. The reason why I asked is the integration takes time and in the interest of the deadline for the tasks, I wanted to know if this allowed.

So, just to clarify - for the iP tasks required to be checked by the auto grader, we can submit code that only displays the functionality required from the level. But we can continue to work on integrating everything separately to be later reviewed by the tutor during the tutorial?

On that note, do we have to show the code directly to the TA during the tutorial or will he pull it from our fork?

Or a more user-friendly way is just to print a message to the user to say something like: "File could not be read - starting with a new save file", then creating a new file for the user to start with (simple, but not exactly an ideal method). As long as there is something in the catch block (that doesn't explicitly force your program to crash), your program shouldn't crash.

## tP Idea
Given a hectic schedule for many investors and traders, our tP product aims to provide them with a simple CLI software to store the instruments they are following or wanting to open a trade in.

## Proposed API usage
[Finnhub API](https://finnhub.io/)
Given the frequently changing nature of market prices and other financial data, it is important that our product also provides real-time financial data to the user. Therefore, we would like to use the data provided by Finnhub API.

## Purpose
The API provides many crucial financial data like the current market price, company profile, etc. The full list of functionalities can be found in the documentation: https://finnhub.io/docs/api/introduction . We will incorporate only the necessary data into our code.

Hi, I understand that there is a clause which reads "customize the chatbot name, command/display formats, and even the personality of the chatbot to make your chatbot unique." under Level-1 iP for Week 3. But is this customization only limited to Level-1 or is it also allowed for future Levels/commits.

As of now, I have programmed my chatbot in such a way that it switches between Echo mode and Add task mode when the user types in "change". Likewise, at start up when the chatbot greets, it also asks the user which mode they would like to enter. Are such customizations allowed or will they be marked down by the grading scripts since particular keywords like "change", or "1" / "2" for the modes, change the way my chatbot functions, which I am guessing the grading scripts will not take into account?

Good day prof. Thanks for your speedy reply on the issue. My team has re-evaluated our need for an API and we have concluded that we can proceed forward with our tP idea even without the API data. As in, our product idea has been tweaked to remove the need for real-time data. We decided that it is better to have the user to input all the data s/he wants to monitor through our CLI programme instead of trying to incorporate the Finnhub API.

The reasons for retreating our proposal for an API:
1) This component only value-adds to our feature but that does not necessarily contribute to higher marks, since the objective of the tP is to assess the fitting in of all product features, how well value proposition and target user needs were met. Hence, my teammates felt that we can still do well and have our tP meet our value proposition without real-time API.
2) Unnecessary work involved in parsing the data for the small number of information fields we need in comparison to the large amount of data the API provides.
3) Concerns raised by teammates about the uncertainty of future tP demands/deliverables and possibility of the constraints of the Finnhub API interfering with our ability to do well in unit testing and other related assessments.
4) Some team members are not confident with the http protocols and coding out a http client in Java.

> In case you cannot use Finnhub, you can take a look at alternative like [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) as it seems to support academic usage. The free membership kinda sucks though because you are limited to 5 requests per minute. Not sure if this is compatible with Gradle so have to check with @okkhoy as well.

Hi Richard, thanks for your input. Alphavantage was the initial API we were relying on actually. To circumvent the 5 requests per minute, our team tried cycling the API token key in between 4 possible keys, switching from one key to another every 3 requests made. However, that idea didn't work and we were still able to have 5 reqs/min. Our TA advised us that this will be a hindarance later on when unit testing. So that's why we proposed Finnhub instead.

The iP description of week 5 section 3 (Add Increment: `A-Packages`) specifies: 
"Recommended: if you are new to git, do this as a separate branch too (for additional practice), similar to how you did `Level-5` (branch name `branch-A-Packages`)."

To my understanding, `branch-A-Packages` should not be a requirement, and it was not included in the iP progress dashboard last week. However, when I check the dashboard again today, there is `branch-A-Packages` in the Admin tasks and there are a lot of students having this task overdue.

Could you please check this again?

Hi Shi,

You can pass arguments to your program by selecting `Edit Configurations...` from the `Run` menu or the `Main` dropdown in the navigation bar (next to the `run` button). You can also right-click on the editor and select `Modify Run Configuration...`.

A new window should pop out like this.

<img width="658" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-18 at 09 19 24" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62022886/129821310-931d8624-0513-40fc-9ca1-8bdc211f6a0c.png">

Write your arguments in the `Program arguments` box and select `OK`/`Apply`, and then run the program as you did before.

Good to know that you solved the problem @DuckWillow.

For your question, @SuibianP provided a very good answer regarding passing conmmand-line arguements. For example, I have a simple `Test.java` file like this:

```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println(args[0]);
    }
}
```

After compiling, if I run `$ java Test arguments with whitespace`, the content printed to the terminal will be `arguments` only. However, if I run `$ java Test "arguments with whitespace"` or `$ java Test 'arguments with whitespace'`, then `arguments with whitespace` will be printed.

Furthermore, as you ask about the way Java reads your **inputs**, you should differentiate between _inputs_ and _command-line arguements_. To read inputs, we can use the`Scanner` class, which I think we will learn in the following weeks. More information can be found in the [Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html). Geeksforgeeks also has a very good [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ways-to-read-input-from-console-in-java/) about this.

I think the rendering on Coursemology is slightly different and nothing wrong with the test cases.

This is the result when I run locally:

```
$ java Main
Your expenses while overseas?nothing. I lived off my friends all the time.
Expenses in overseas currency:[]
Total in local currency: $0.00
```

And it passes all the test cases.

Firstly, don't compile the chatbot with javac. Doing so will create `.class` files in the `out/production/ip/` directory, and we don't want to push those files to GitHub. Build and run your program with IntelliJ instead.

After building with IntelliJ, the `.class` file(s) can be found at `out/production/ip/*.class`, and the `/out/` directory is included the `.gitignore` file.

```
# IDEA files
/.idea/
/out/
/*.iml
```

Therefore, the `.class` file(s) will not be pushed to the remote repo, which means that building and running the program before pushing or not does not affect the content you push to GitHub.

TLDR: You don't have to compile the chatbot each time you push.

You should check if there are any extra spaces/newline characters, which may be hard to detect if you build and run your program with IntelliJ. 

Compile and run your program manually with `javac` instead, feed the output to a `.txt` file (e.g. `output.txt`), write a new file of the expected output (e.g. `expected.txt`), and then compare those 2 files by `diff` on Unix-bases OS or `FC` on Windows. Doing so may also detect hidden warnings that IDEs sometimes ignore.

If all seems fine on your local machine, make sure each file on Coursemology has the same content as those on your computer.

If you have pushed every commits except the merge commit to the remote repo, simply clone the remote repo to you local machine, merge without fast-forward, and push it.

If not, since you have not pushed the commits to the remote repo, the fast-forward merge has not been detected by the grading script. You can refer to [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2389361/undo-a-git-merge-that-hasnt-been-pushed-yet) to undo that merge. In case you have pushed your fast-forward merge to the remote repo, you can refer to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14308580/undo-a-fast-forward-merge) to restore the commits.

Basically, they are the same. The second line uses a diamond operator `&gt;>`, which is an example of type inference. Java can infer that `listOfTasks` should be an instance of `LinkedList&gt;Task>` since the compile-time type of `listOfTasks` is `LinkedList&gt;Task>`.

You can refer to the [CS2030S website](https://nus-cs2030s.github.io/2021-s2/24-inference.html) for more details.

It seems that your syntax is correct but the output is not as expected.

Sometimes GitHub may not render the markdown files correctly. You may want to generate the GitHub page to see how it behaves. Also, you have edited the `README.md` file in the root directory, while the correct file that needs to be updated is `docs\README.md`.

Furthermore, you should consider using backticks to wrap the code (`bye`) instead of bolding it.

For the increment mentioned in the title. the minimum requirement is to extract the classes, one of which is the Storage class. I have already implemented a FileManager interface in my previous increment, which my TaskManager class implements.  Do I have to convert it to a class to be able to pass this increment?

Thank you for your help. I realised that I had not pushed anything to master after creating the new branch and had been pushing to the remote branch-Level-5 while working on this week's increment. Hence, I used the "git reset --hard origin/master" command to reset my local master branch to be the same as the remote master branch, then merged with the local branch-Level-5 without fast forward.

Hi Prof and TAs, I was comparing my code to others and I realized that I had a much different implementation in that my Commands are all in one enum class while there are people that implemented their commands as separate classes. Hence I wanted to ask when should concepts be implemented as enums and when should they be implemented as classes? Referencing the guide, it says "enumeration is often useful when using a regular data type such as int or String would allow invalid values to be assigned to a variable." which would make sense for the commands in that there's only a few valid commands. However, I'm certain that beyond a certain functionality requirement, it makes more sense to use classes.

Hi there prof Akshay,

For our tP, our group had decided on developing a Chess command-line game. While we're all excited about the project, we're also nervous because looking at other teams (past and present), no one has attempted such a project. One of the issues we're facing is with regards to the AI and we were wondering if it would be possible for us to use stockfish (https://stockfishchess.org/) as an external dependency. Given that SF is written in C++ though, we would compile the program and pipe the commands and responses from our java application to and from the program. This could lead to dependency issues as we might not be able to test our program on Mac. There are other open-source AIs that are written in java, but they are mostly obscure git projects (https://github.com/albertoruibal/carballo) and it could raise some questions on whether we 'plagerised' their code because if we're trying to understand how their AI works, we'd have to understand their OOP. Hence Stockfish would be better in this sense as it would be a 'black box' we use as our AI. We were thinking of making the first iteration something along the lines of PvP on a single console but we realised that the project requirement is 'Constraint-Single-User' Also, given that the tP requirement of fulfilling an iP worth of code for every individual is somewhat obscure, we would like to seek your opinion on whether it would be advisable to pursue this project? Also. we aren't opposed to possibly coding our own AI function (something we aren't opposed to learning more about). But we're unsure if we'd get any marks for the whole AI component.

If we can't get an approval for an AI library and we wouldn't get any marks for an AI implementation, is it too late to change our project?

I had one enum class for my commands which I would use to store the number of args and the usage message (would be printed when command was entered incorrectly) and then I would parse the command to the enum using typeOf and switch the command enum to determine which functions to execute. Though I've changed it to individual classes because it seems like that's more functional programing and less OOP.

My current understanding of user stories in the issue tracker is that they are just there for the record and not used as actual issues. eg. If something needs to be added then there would be an issue created called "Add something" and a separate user story for that issue (a new issue in the form of " As a user I need something" ) would be created, but mainly the "Add Something" issue would be used to assign to people and linked to pull requests.

But now I'm thinking I may have misunderstood and it might have been that the main "Add something" issue should have been renamed to be in a user story format (or the user story should have been in the description of the issue).

Would greatly appreciate anyone's advice on this, maybe its that both ways are valid but one way is better than the other?

So you can just rename the downloaded JAR file and submit. The name of JAR in GitHub can just follow the previous JAR files.

I am facing an issue with the Text UI Testing part of the IP. The .bat file cannot read more than 1 line of input into the program, and returns the following error:

`Exception in thread "main" java.util.NoSuchElementException: No line found`
        `at java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextLine(Scanner.java:1651)`
        `at Duke.main(Duke.java:11)`


The relevant code segment is below:
```java 
do {
    Scanner line = new Scanner(System.in);
    String[] input = line.nextLine().split(" ", 2);
    switch (input[0]) {
    case "bye":
        taskManager.exitMessage();
        isExit = true;
        break;
     //remainder of the input cases below
     }
} while (!isExit);
```
Input.txt is as below
`todo fly`
`deadline fall /by 2pm` 
`bye` 

The ACTUAL.TXT produced stops after the first input line, which is "todo fly". Am I using scanner wrong? Thanks in advance

Hello All who have taken time to read.

It turns out that putting the Scanner creation line within the loop was causing the problem. The solution was to move it out of the loop. I hope no one else spends 3 hours trying to deal with this too üëç .

Sorry prof, since we are the devs I think we might be biased since we implicitly know how our app works, so I am having trouble understanding from the reader's perspective. Hence I would like to seek further clarification.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69298017/141649969-8f4441f8-4e6d-43ed-b41a-201e28b95b0f.png)
In our case, we showed that user inputs govern what kind of command is instantiated, but we did not explicitly state the exact commands required e.g. `add`, `clear`, `delete`, `show`. Under the implementation of Show, the reader expressed confusion at what user input created ShowCommand (which is `show`), since it was not explicitly stated.
May I clarify if this is considered a bug, and if so what severity would it be under?

```java
    public void execute(Ui ui, HashMap<String, String> parameters, ArrayList<Medicine> medicines) {
        String[] requiredParameter = {CommandParameters.ID};
        String[] optionalParameters = {CommandParameters.PRICE, CommandParameters.QUANTITY,

                CommandParameters.MAX_QUANTITY};
         // More code here
    }
```

For the following code snippet, Gradle would flag that `'array initialization' child has incorrect indentation level 16, expected level should be one of the following: 12, 39, 42.` But according to the coding standards, shouldn't indentation for wrapped lines be 8 spaces? Thus in this case it should be 16 spaces instead of 12?

However, when I build and run the project, it works perfectly fine. May I know if this is normal? If not, is there a way to fix this?

Hi all

I'm running into an issue when trying to update the text-ui testing. For some reason, when using the automated testing, some exceptions are not being caught and are stopping the program. But when I run the same input on command line, responds correctly.

Here is the code for the try-catch:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69444734/132969598-632571c3-77ce-4178-a9d6-41cf56c9f510.png)

Just in the case where the input is "done" where the entry number is missing:
Running on command line and manually putting in the input works and gets the correct response:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69444734/132969616-7d2b8843-af2b-48e2-b915-1b02c033ce10.png)

but running the automated testing with just "done" in input.txt:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69444734/132969657-cca25a0c-0f07-4f86-800e-6ae7f117cf17.png)
The exception that causes the program to stop should have been caught by the catch block, as it does when manually input. 

Any ideas what's going wrong? Other try-catch blocks work both with manual and automated testing. Only this block seems to have problems.

Thanks!

Hi,

I am currently working on my IP and I forgot to do a pull request for A-javadoc branch and simply merged it and pushed it to github. I would like to know how can I revert this merge for A-javadoc and perform the required pull request needed. An SS of my tree is below.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80661630/135295818-891adb6b-e12b-4fef-8807-9c04667b59cd.png)

I saw this method (attached below) and am unsure if it will work. In short, it suggests to hard-reset my master branch to a commit before the merge & then use `git push origin master --force-with-lease` to push my master branch into GH. Does anyone know if this will work? Also, is it ok to use `--force-with-lease` or should I avoid it?

I think it is because of the initialisation of the array shape to size 100, when you run the first for loop, it gives an error because not all 100 spaces are used, whereas the second for loop you are iterating through the array with data (Circle and Rectangle) stored when you addShape instead of the whole array.

I just fixed this issue as well. Try going under finder->go->library if u cant find the library try pressing command + shift + . to see hidden files. Go under application support then find Source tree. Delete all files with "@" this essentially removes any auth or password memory to github from source tree. Then create a personal access token in ur github account. Go under settings->developer settings-> personal access tokens and generate a new token. Copy and paste ur token id somewhere and this will be ur new password to github. Then follow as the video shows and add ur new account in Sourcetree with ur password being this new id. U must do this before pushing and it should work.
