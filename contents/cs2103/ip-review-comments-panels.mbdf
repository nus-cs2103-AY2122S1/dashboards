Perhaps it would be better to merge these two test cases in the same method and add message parameter in `assertEquals` method to distinguish them rather than name it as `toString_descriptionOfTodo1` and `toString_descriptionOfTodo2` since I think they are testing the same method in the same scenario and returning the same type of result, and the naming of 1 and 2 looks confusing? 🤔

Hi Jivesh, hope you're doing well.
Overall, some things you should fix (coding style wise) are adding spaces after `if` and `for` statements and adding the braces to your `if` `else` blocks even if there is only 1 statement inside. Apart from that remember to add Javadocs for your public classes and methods as well and take note of your import order access modifier order and using wildcard imports. Lastly, for switch statements ensure the `switch` and `case` statements are on the same indentation level.
Cheers!

Perhaps a better name for this method will be `parse`? I think we generally should avoid adding '-ing' behind our methods and class names.

Hi Timothy! I'm Marcus. Did a review for standard coding practices. Apologies if I had to nitpick because the code was very well formatted so there wasn't much that was substantial which I could say. Well done! One last thing in general do keep an extra line after your last line of code in each file, I believe it will fail checkStyle without that.

**Review Status:** COMMENTED

Coding standard is quite closely adhered to 👍. Main suggestions for changes are in inclusion of more JavaDocs and making import statements lexicographically ordered. 

Also this is quite nitpicky but there are 2 more potential improvements regarding coding standard, although they're more a matter of style:
1. Start regular comments with a capitalised first letter
2. Standardise spacing/alignment after JavaDoc tags (e.g. for the JavaDocs of the `execute` method in `AddCommand.java`, description of `@throws AisuException` is not aligned with those of the other `@param` tags)

Overall well done on the code! 🎉

Using `input.startsWith("...")` may cause some invalid commands to be interpreted as valid commands, e.g. when input starts with `deadliner` or `todoy`. Instead, consider using `input.split(" ", 2)` to get a `String[]`, then check equality against the first element of the `String[]`. This way, the second element of the `String[]` also contains all the information you need for your `Command` subclasses later on.

It's possible to just use `task` here as the conversion to String type is done implicitly (like how you don't have to convert `size` to a String).

Hi there, I've looked through your code and your code quality is generally good with some minor improvements to be made 😊. 

Good use of OOP is evident, especially through the abstract `Task` and `Command` classes. You may also consider adding JavaDocs to the public constructors and methods to ease readability. 

Great work on the code overall! 👍

Maybe for this method (and similar methods in this class), you could rename the methods to this format: 
"&gt;command>Message". So for this case, maybe something like "goodbyeMessage". Feel free to use or not use my suggesstion though!

Hi Great job on your code! I think your methods are all of suitable length and your code is generally quite readable, although i think some comments can be removed if the line of code it is referencing is easy to understand. Taking away some comments can reduce the clutter too! I like your OOP approach as well. Overall really good job!

Thank you so much for letting me know that I made a mistake with giving a feedback on your switch-case coding standard Tze Jit! I made a reply to all my comments to make sure it was my mistake. Overall, maybe because you used the checkstyle script to self-evaluate your codes, if we don't count my stupid mistakes, I don't detect any coding standard violations in your code! Very good job!

However, I think there's some room for improvement if you could change a bit of naming conventions and some minor things.
Good job again!

interesting way to go bout w TaskList, perhaps a composition might be more suitable in case you want to add other details inside TaskList like timeAccessed juz to name a random example. With inheritance, its somewhat more limiting if you follow the logic that TaskList is an ArrayList (imo)

ok, by right i should only be commenting bout code practices but i really really think youd find using regex & placing the logic of parsing into each of the subtasks much easier.

By having so many methods reliant on so many tasks, its gonna be hard to modify it.
But if you abstract the logic and put the parseLine() static method inside each task, could always just change that when you change the syntax. just fyi :)

Sorry if I spammed the comments >&gt; Overall, really good effort can see you really put in alot of time and tried to organise the code with meaningful segmentations and spacing. I feel your pain cos Im rly struggling with this project as well, but I really recommend you consider changing the logic of the program, might make it easier for you to extend it :)

Most of your codes are structured logically, good job! I feel that it can be even better if you break your code down and make it easier to maintain.
BTW, I noticed that you included the `jar` file in your commits. According to the module website, maybe attaching it in a new release is better.

Your code looks really good to me! Just a few nitpicks here and there but nothing too imp. Some classes and functions are missing javadocs. While they do seem redundant sometimes, its generally good practice to include them anyways. There were a few lines of commented out code which personally I would remove so that it improves readability. Apart from those nitpicks  I thought your code was very easy to read and very well done! 😄

Consider making this a concrete method instead of abstract since only 1 command will return true. So just override it for ExitCommand and you don't have to implement it in all the other commands.

Would it be better if you do the declaration and initialisation together in the respective case blocks, and doing `tasks.add(task)` in the case block as well? I think that this has the benefit of ensuring that the task will never be `null`, especially if the logic is changed in some way in future.

Overall lgtm, good job! Just have to take note a few nits in coding standards styling. In general, it would be good to refrain from copying code, such as in `Task.java` where there are many `return "";` lines. It could be an abstract class as well. But well done for iP in this short amount of time :)

Perhaps we can consider using `anchorPane` here instead of `ap`. I get that since the number of lines in this function is short, the meaning of `ap` is pretty obvious, however once the number of lines here get too long or the `Scene scene = new Scene(ap);` line moves too far away, the meaning of `ap` might not be as obvious anymore.

Since method names should make use of verbs, I suggest using `writeTaskToFile` or `appendTaskToFile` or `addTaskToFile` instead. This is because of two reasons:
- Method names should make use of verbs. 
- Method name tells me you are dealing with "line" when the parameter is actually a `Task`. 

Alternatively, `addToFile` or `writeToFile` etc. may also be good enough since the parameter already implies that we are only working with a `Task`.

Really small issue, but I'm curious as to why BufferedWriter was initialised as bufferedWriter, but FileWriter fileWrite didn't follow this convention as well (fileWrite vs fileWriter).

Then again, since fileWrite isn't used anywhere else, you may also possibly consider instantiating it directly within bufferedWriter? Same with fileReader in the same class, but this is probably entirely up to preference.

Pokemon exception handling (Catching them all) is generally not recommended. May I suggest listing and catching specific intended exceptions? 

eg) catch (ParseException | IllegalArgumentException | FileNotFoundException e) {...}

Commands seem to be used in multiple files (Duke.java and Parser.java). May I suggest abstracting it to a Commands.java enum file? If not you may end up updating one without doing so for the other.

It may be better to put the file location in the Storage class as it is directly related to storage, which in that case, you wouldn't have to pass it in into the constructor of Duke.

It can be initialised as a private static final string FILE_LOCATION, which makes it easier to find, debug and edit if necessary.

I'm not so sure if documentation for getters is necessary. To compare it with your `TaskList` class, there are trivial methods there that are undocumented. Hence, to be consistent, I suggest, either adding documentation to those methods as well, or removing documentation for methods whose purpose is clear from the name.

Interesting use of `var`. :) (and elsewhere in your code)
To give another perspective of this however, without an ide, say I'm viewing the codebase on github, I think it would be harder to tell what is the type of the variable. Hence, I'm not so sure if this is the "Java" way. I suppose this is still way better than reading raw code from many dynamically typed languages out there.
Regardless, viewing code without an ide probably isn't a major usecase these days so this shouldn't be an issue.

I like the documentation a lot. It's very well done and makes code reading pleasant.

On the whole, I like the organization of the code and separation of responsibilities. It is quite clean. My only nitpicks are certain commented out pieces of code, some of which do seem unnecessary and can be deleted safely.

For the future, I also suggest putting a bit more documentation as from what I observe, documentation is only restricted to the class-level and not the methods.

Doing this kind of defeats the purpose of using enum, right? Instead of using enum purely as strings, I suggest parsing the user input into enum, then using the enum to return the appropriate commands.

Overall, I think this was a really great job! There were a few minor coding standard violations, such as constant names not being capitalised (and separated by underscores) as well as some methods that could have had better names.

Good job and also was nice to see credit being given in the comments!

Overall, I think that the code was really good, and I liked some of the methods used to validate commands as well as the OOP implementations (e.g. of errors). There were a couple of minor coding standard violations such as constant variables not being capitalised and some of the methods not being verbs, but in general coding standards were followed well.

Hi Bryan, I was assigned to peer review your code. I really liked the idea in your Duke.java of using a HashTable to map userinput to a command. It also gave me 2030s and 2040s flashback😆 .

Hi ZiQing, as part of my tutorial for week 5, I am allocated to PR your code for any code quality issues. But looking so far, besides the couple thoughts I've shared on the comments. It looks great. 

I really liked your implementation of the sort feature in your programme. It also brought me back 2030S vibes. 😆 

Perhaps a suggestion you could consider also, given you have alot of String constants in your code, you could consider creating another java file that stores all your String constants for ease of access and modification. Hope this helps :)

Hi Amos, I think your code is pretty cool. I quite liked the enum for commands that you did. 

I think the main issues are
- The Eygptian braces 
- Missing some javadocs here and there
Apart from that I think its ok! (I hope I didn't miss anything) 
Hope you find this useful!

Hi Shawn, I think your code has some minor issues in terms of readability. Otherwise, I think this is a pretty solid implementation, based on the general structure of the program. I also liked the detailed Javadoc descriptions, especially on file headers. I left some comments here, feel free to reply to them if you need further clarification.

Enums contain a set of predefined constants. I think by convention, if you were to stick to using an enum for Commands, it would be something like

private enum Commands { LIST, DONE, TODO, EVENT, DEADLINE, DELETE, FIND }

I'm not sure switch case can work here, as the author wants to use the method `.startsWith()` from the `String` object, but it is possible to do some small hacks. I can suggest two possible alternatives here:
- Preserve the if-else blocks, but comply with the coding standard
- You may look at `.split()` method to take the first command and use it into the switch statement

When you import your classes, I think it would be better to list them explicitly.
```suggestion
import java.io.IOException;
import ...
```
This adheres to the coding standards, which should be the same for your tP. Additionally, it gives excellent documentation value for the team. I believe for IntelliJ, if 3 or more classes are imported from the same package, IntelliJ automatically converts it into a wilcard import, this limit can be toggled or turned off within your IDE settings.

Overall, really good stuff 👍 Just need to be a bit careful of those spaces and indentations, especially for your if and while blocks. I forget about those sometimes as well, perhaps you can configure your editor (File > Settings > Editor > Code Style > Java) to follow the coding standards. This way, you just need to run the reformat code (ctrl + alt + j) before you commit your changes. There are also a few other cosmetic issues like javadoc comments and naming conventions for methods and arguments, but these are rather minor. All the files are packaged nicely, with most of the methods having descriptive comments.

hm, this is interesting. May I know why you decided to group the adding of tasks as one command, instead of separating them such as "AddListCommand", "AddDeadlineCommand"? ... I think as the code-base gets bigger, and if you do choose to implement more different types of tasks, this class and in particular the execute and getTaskDescription methods can get pretty messy.

Perhaps you can have a parent class like DinoException, where all these exceptions extend from this DinoException class. Then the method signature could be throws DinoException instead, of having such a long method signature. I think it would be quite a headache, when you add more exceptions and will have to change the method signatures of your command classes.

May I suggest using a StringBuilder instead, since String is immutable in Java, and concatenation creates a new String each time, resulting in O(n^2) time complexity. I think for simple string concatenation, using the '+' operator is fine, but because you are looping through all the tasks in your taskList, I think it can get quite costly.

This is a functionality issue rather than a code quality issue. It seems that the keyword is only searched on the task title. Perhaps you can just search the whole string so as to allow users to search for dates as well ie. `at` from `Event` and `by` from `Deadline`.

If I'm not wrong, I think this class will never be used as if the `EXIT` command is being detected in the `canHandle()` method in `Blue` class, `ui` will `sayGoodbye()` and `shouldContinue` is `false` thus breaking out of the while loop.

This parse() method is a bit too long and there might be some violation of SLAP rule. Maybe we can consider extracting some String calculation, task initialization and task execution to form new methods for better abstraction.

In this case, perhaps it would be better to not pass the command word into the `String input` .
This is because you would have already checked the command word in the parser hence there is no need to pass it in again into the command object. In this case there will be no need to call split again hence making this a bit more efficient.

Perhaps you could try to avoid using "Magic Numbers" like 3 here, as it is not obvious what significance it has.

I like that your code is documented well with comments and that it follows the naming convention quite closely 👍 
There were parts where the code was nested heavily, and instances where the code looked confusing where you used magic numbers like 3 or 2,, but all in all I liked it 😄

I like the cleanliness of your code for the most part.
Well thought-out variable and method names like loadData, isCompleted.
There are some portions where your code deviated from the coding conventions however: 
- Javadoc comments are missing for some classes and methods
- Unnecessary gaps between lines
- Did not use camel case for variable names

Nothing wrong with this, but there's no need to end your substrings with "\n". You could have combined the substrings together to make it more compact!

I feel like it might be more aligned to OOP principles to have this String parsing done within the specific Task classes, and just calling this method here e.g. public String toFileString() { return String.format( ...); }

This is double checking for input validity! Would be cleaner to check for invalid command input at the end of this else block e.g. if else statements checking if it starts with "todo"/"event"/"deadline", and one last else that throws a DukeException otherwise.

I think it's advisable not to check for validity using String length in this case, especially if you're not sanitising the input using .trim() . For example, if the input was "todo " with whitespaces at the end, it should be considered an invalid input, but I believe your code does not catch it.

Overall almost all the namings are done in line with the guidelines given to us. Super impressed with the readability and neatness of the code. Just that due to the complexity of command-processing classes, it may be best to be commented with more explanation on how the entire process works to a rockie outsider coder like me. :D 
Great Job!

Overall, I see consistent good coding standards being especially for the `for` loops and conditional statements! The spacing and indentation made it super easy to read. However, I do observe some common places for improvements: 
1. ordering of the imports
2. comments indentation and lack of javadoc comments
3. naming of variables. 

Nonetheless still good job! Looking forward to the more updated version as I think it may be a few versions behind the schedule.

Overall, I found that your code was quite easy to read and your methods also contain an appropriate number of lines of code (not too lengthy and nested). 
However, some of the classes may be getting too long. One example will be Duke.java, where classes that serve other purposes are also being declared in the same file. You can consider splitting it into different class files.
Also, do take extra note when naming variables or methods, so as to improve readability of the code. Otherwise, good job! 😁

Generally, it will be better/recommended to write header comments for all public classes and methods, to allow readers to gain a better understanding of these without having to read the code? 
Also, for methods with many lines of code, it will be good to separate the logical units, and introduce each of these blocks with a comment, to improve readability.
Else, other than some minor coding standard violations to fix, LGTM! 👍🏽

Overall, code quality is pretty good and I didn't find many violations. 
However, you are missing javadocs in many classes (all public methods must have them iirc) and there are some coding standard violations you can take note of. It is also better to put your classes in separate packages, ie. `storage`, `tasks`, `util` instead of all in one `duke` package.

`switch` statements should have a `break;` statement at the end of each `case` block. When a fallthrough is intended, a comment can be added to indicate this to other reviewers/ software engineers - e.g. `// Fallthrough`

There is some code repetition here. How about an abstraction such as
```java
void say(String message) {
    System.out.println(MSG_DIVIDER);
    System.out.println(message);
    System.out.println(MSG_DIVIDER);
}
```
Then, for example, you can do
```java
say(MSG_EXIT);
say(e.getMessage());
```

Generally exception as control flow (i.e. throwing an exception above and catching it a few lines below) is not a good idea. Maybe a better way for this try-catch block might be:  
```
try {
    taskNumber = Integer.parseInt(tokens[1]);
    if (!isTaskDoneCommand || taskNumber > tasks.size()) {
        throw new InvalidIndexException("done");
    }
catch (NumberFormatException err) {
     throw new InvalidIndexException("done");

and catch `InvalidIndexException` in `src/main/java/Duke/Parser.java`.

This `load()` method might be too long. This [coding quality website](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/codeQuality.html#avoid-long-methods) stated the following:

> Be wary when a method is longer than the computer screen, and take corrective action when it goes beyond 30 LOC (lines of code). The bigger the haystack, the harder it is to find a needle.

LGTM! Really clean code! All functions and variables (such as boolean variables) are all named as they should be. Just a few minor mistakes! 
Additionally, I'm not sure how important this is but in the website for [coding standards](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html#comments), the @param descriptions, @return descriptions, etc, in the javadocs start with a capital letter, as seen:
```java
/**
 * Returns lateral location of the specified position.
 * If the position is unset, NaN is returned.
 *
 * @param x  X coordinate of position.
 * @param y Y coordinate of position.
 * @param zone Zone of position.
 * @return Lateral location.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException  If zone is <= 0.
 */
public double computeLocation(double x, double y, int zone)
    throws IllegalArgumentException {
  ...
}

Shouldn't method names be a little more descriptive? Perhaps consider naming the method something that will tell us what it does (i.e. findTask)!

Hopefully I am not misunderstanding your code (and correct me if I am!), but I believe that instead of the repeated use of
```java
input = sc.nextLine();
continue;
```

You could merely declare `String input = null;` or `String input;` at line 27, and then place the line 
`input = sc.nextLine()` at the start of the while loop between line 31 and 32. Then you can subsequently remove all lines of `continue` as well. 

Resultantly, in this program it will look at a singular `if` / `if else` block, complete an action, and then loop to get the next line of input.

The `switch` block below can then either be split into a separate method (to shorten this method as mentioned in my other comment), or simply be converted into more `if else` blocks.

Just a suggestion! 😸

Generally, I do not see any major issues. However, the readibility of the code could be improved. I saw some complicated expressions that can be broken down into [more readable steps](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/codeQuality.html#avoid-complicated-expressions). I too, had complicated expressions in my code and I found it hard to mantain and debug, and I have spent some time to clean them up. If you have time, maybe you could also work on the documentations. All the best! :)

Since a task is either a Deadline or Event or any other classes that are subclass of Task, it won't be a Deadline or Event at the same time. Hence, I feel that using "if" and "else if" is better than "if and if" since you only need to check if a task is an instance of Event only if it is not an instance of Deadline.

Isn't this inconsistent ordering of import statements? In other files you have added spaces between different types of import statements, here you haven't. Again not a significant issue, but remember that a consistent ordering of import statements makes it easier to browse the list and determine the dependencies when there are many imports.

I feel that the code is structured quite well and there is good use of OOP! Maybe consider renaming certain methods/variables and reduce the use of duplicate code to make the code base easier to understand.

Perhaps you should start your header comment with a verb? As described in 2103T Java Style Guide 

```
Write the first sentence as a short summary of the method, as Javadoc automatically places it in the method summary table (and index).

    In method header comments, the first sentence should start in the form Returns ..., Sends ..., Adds ... (not Return or Returnning etc.)

Overall, I think this is a really well done PR, and it is very difficult for me to spot any flaws. Please note that anything I did manage to point out is very trivial compared to the overall high quality of everything else. I am really impressed that you have already implemented and merged your JavaFX code, unlike me who is still behind the schedule.

I feel there are too many empty lines in this chunk of code, which affects readibility as a lot more scrolling is needed. Consider cutting down some of them? I noticed this pattern happening elsewhere, but this part is much more pronounced, so I believe you might be adhering to your own internal convention regarding how many blank lines to leave. Even so, I think breaking this convention is worth it if there are going to be this many empty lines.

Overall, the code quality is very much decent, with a few minor nits. I see almost every JavaDocs is too skeletonised, with almost no description of parameters if any. It might be better to have fewer, but more developed JavaDocs, and this would also fit the module requirements better. Also, I think the number of empty lines can be cut down.

Very small suggestion: Perhaps it would be better to still keep an else if clause here, and then handle the else case when it doesn't match any type as well. It's unlikely that this will be an issue but maybe its better to be defensive here in case in the future there are more task types and this method is not updated by mistake

Logic here involves the task list. It may be more appropriate to extract into a method in a task list class. Ideally UI takes string from user to pass to pass to parser and takes string from duke and prints, since the UI is an interface between duke and user. All other logic can be defined in other classes.

Since if I am not wrong, there are no external package subclasses that require these two variables, perhaps you can consider making these private?

While I do like that your Javadoc header comments are very descriptive, I think it may be desirable to have a short first sentence as a summary (usually one line). Maybe you could consider opting to use more subsequent sentences for describing in more detail. I noticed this in other places as well, though it is a minor issue and it is definitely better that you are descriptive (which I really like) than having no description at all.

Is this [amount of nesting](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/codeQuality.html#avoid-deep-nesting) necessary? Maybe you can consider moving each nested `if` block out of its parent `if` and then put it after the parent `if` block since you can take advantage of the thrown exceptions to make subsequent statements unreachable as intended. Not sure if that makes sense so here's an example.
From this:
```java
if (isCondition1) {
    // everything within these braces is unreachable if isCondition1 is false
    if (isCondition2) {
        // ...
    } else {
        // ...
    }
} else {
    // ...
    throw new DukeException("...");
}
```
To this:
```java
if (isCondition1) {
    // ...
} else {
    // ...
    throw new DukeException("...");
}
// everything after this is still unreachable if isCondition1 is false because
// the exception would then be thrown before this
if (isCondition2) {
    // ...
} else {
    // ...
}
```

Any reason why you catch the exceptions in these Parser methods instead of throwing it to the main caller in Pib to catch? Since they all throw the same type of PibException, letting Pib catch these exceptions when it is calling these methods seems like a better control flow to me.

Is it better if commands are implemented as inherited classes from a `Command` interface? It may better adhere to the open-close principle. Each command may have their own implementation of what is executed, and it seems cleaner to only have to create a class for every new command introduced, rather than tempering with the switch statement in `Duke.java`.

In the guidelines of CS2103T, abbreviations are written in the form of `Gui`, `Sql` and `Html`. Even though I agree that it's seemingly contradicting with Java's practices (`java.sql.SQLXML` and `java.util.UUID`), I think it might be better to stick to the module's coding standard.

I personally prefer to use enum classes for this instead (e.g. `TaskType`). Unlike using enums for commands, the type of task serves no purpose other than deciding the exact Task class to reconstruct your classes from the database, though it does sounds like an extra step.

Overall really good use of OOP and nice job on the Calendar feature!

One thing I noticed with the design implementation was a persisting check on todo/deadline/event. Within `Parser.java`, all 3 cases are grouped to return a `TaskCommand` which then calls upon `handleTask` in `TaskList.java` where you parse it to different cases again.

Personally, I feel maybe having a subclass of `TaskCommand` to handle these separately might be better. After which, handling the command input parsing seems more aligned to the duties of the corresponding command class and not within `TaskList` (if command format changes for example, current implementation means you need to modify the `TaskList` methods and not the `TaskCommand` class)

Any thoughts on this?

Overall, it looks quite good and nice use of OOP!

One thing I would point out is that the `Parser` class is also handling the user input from the scanner which might be better suited for the `Ui` class. 

A `Command` class would also be a nice addition if time permits.

Other than that, it looks good to me!

Your code quality seems okay to me but I may have missed out on certain things as it was getting hard to read without blank line separation between different blocks.

It would be good to have blank line separation as it helps in readability.

I'm not very sure which is more efficient, but it seems like the code would look shorter if you can extract the 4 common lines for "D |" and "E |" into another if statement block.

also, I think `String taskDescriptionAndTime = line.substring(startingIndex);` could be extracted out of this 3 blocks since it is common to all conditionals! 👯

Hello! Generally looks good to me but you can take note of some places where your code can be simplified further. 👍 Also for clarity and neatness, for longer code (like in Storage.java), you can also consider doing line breaks to group up related code if necessary!

According to the coding standard, the format of a case block does not have curly braces, and only requires the colon. Your other switch block in `Storage.java` line 58 is correct, I would suggest following that as well.

This is minor and subjective, but I think replacing `ind` with `index` will make the code more readable, and does not significantly change the length of the variable name.

Overall nice job! I like how your Event class has both a start and end time.

I think one thing that can be done is to abstract away details and push them into new methods or into the Task classes (which seems a little too empty)?

Not a major issue, just a small grammatical error to use "an" instead of "a" before **EmptyCommand** in the Javadoc. Might want to ensure that the Javadoc is free of grammatical error. However, most of your Javadoc is already really well done, just a minor one here. 😄

Method name should not start with a capital letter, i.e. should be `stringToDate`. Also, may I ask why is your method a `public static` method, if you place a comment above it saying it's a helper function? If it is a helper function and is called in the class, maybe it should just be a `private` method?

Any possible reason why your `map` method has a nested function block in it? Maybe to make your code neater, you can try and push the function block out as a private method, if its not state-dependent. Example:
``` java
public static List<Task> getTasksFromFile() {
    List<Task> tasks = new ArrayList<>();
    try {
        tasks = Files.newBufferedReader(Paths.get(FILE_PATH))
                .lines()
                .skip(1)
                .map(this::parseTask)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return tasks;
}

private Task parseTask(String s) throws IOException {
    // migrated method contents omitted

Overall, I find the code is relatively neat and there is a nice flow in logic during my browsing. However, there are some code standards issues that might need to be fixed. One way to aid you in making checks is using a `checkstyle.xml` file and `Gradle`.

To do this, you can go to https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle and obtain the `.XML` files needed, since it follows very similarly to our module requirements.  

Create the same directory path in your own `iP` repo (`repo/config/checkstyle/*.xml`). Then you can just use the `Gradle` panel > `Tasks` > `other` > `checkstyleMain` or `checkstyleTest` which will run and give you a report of code style violations (if any) in the terminal output (which gives a hyperlink to a local `HTML` page with the results).

All the best for the rest of your `iP` and **CS2103**!

Method names should be verbs instead of nouns, according to the coding standard that we are following. Instead, consider something like `Ui.sendGreetings()` or `Ui.greetUser()`

I think I agree with Vimuth. We might naturally expect a `Parser` class to only parse input and sort them out/respond to input that cannot be parsed, but not necessarily scanning for the input itself. The `Ui` class on the other hand, could definitely handle both input (receiving input) and output (printing messages to user)

Notice that this method is a noun, and actually, sounds like an object. Perhaps this would be better as an individual class for the sake of OOP if you have time. Else, the actions to take in response to a command you retrieve from parsing, may fit better elsewhere (Maybe in the main class if you're not encapsulating this into a different class) rather than leave this in the `Parser`

This method name sounds a little verbose, although there is nothing wrong with it. Perhaps try names that describe what  it does less, and more of what it is for? E.g. If this is the function to be used to display every form of output, this could simply be named `display` or `displayMessage`.

The first sentence as a summary for the method should be a verb to be as descriptive as possible. According to the coding standards, it could start with `Returns...`, `Sends...`, or `Adds...` for example. Thus, I think that `Constructs` might be more appropriate here.
</panel>

Since this is a test rather than a simple boolean check (if a certain file exists), and is instead a test for whether a save file can be saved and reloaded, I think it can be named more appropriately. E.g. `saveFileTest` perhaps?

Perhaps we can use `enum` here to simplify the logic here! Also, personally I fell that all the `try-catch` statement here can be abstracted to other class method e.g. `createDone()` etc. to prevent arrowhead style code, and that one single `catch` for `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` could be used for the entire method. Don't know if I articulate my idea in a very accurate way 😂

LGTM, mostly. A few minor coding standard violations that can be easily fixed. 

Some files like Brain are have relatively many lines of code, and are vaguely named. 
In my opinion, it might be better to split it up into several smaller components with more concrete names that are easier to understand so that it's easier to find and edit particular spots in the future. 
For example, perhaps you could have one class for each command, that handles the brain's functionality, as well as the parser's error handling functionality.

Be careful about this, for this module the requirement for writing switch cases is little different from what we encountered before.

Hi, you seem to have followed the coding standards pretty well, so good job on that! As for the deleteTask method here, I am assuming it returns a boolean? But the name of the method does not make it clear that it returns a boolean. Perhaps you could rename it to wasTaskDeleted()?

Perhaps you could add a header JavaDoc for getResponse since it is a public method, to fit with coding style standards.

I think in general we don't do use toString to get the exception details instead we use a method called getMessage which is a method of the Exception class. That said I think this is fine as well. Excellent work on the multiple types of exceptions you have created from this abstract class.

This part seems pretty complicated, perhaps you could do this in steps like: 
```java
String taskDesc = taskType + ":\n--> " + prefix + " " + input; 

String taskTime = type == 2
        ? "(By: " + LocalDateTime.parse(time, inputFormatter).format(outputFormatter) + ")"
        : type == 3
            ? "(At: " + LocalDateTime.parse(time, inputFormatter).format(outputFormatter) + ")"
            : "";

System.out.println("-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~\n"
        + "Alright. I've added the following " + taskDesc + taskTime + ...) 
```
Or even place the expression for taskTime into a separate method!

An advanced coding standard that you can consider following is to avoid unnecessary use of `this` with fields.

You may want to use a switch statement for this long if else. It may be good because you're comparing strings and it can directly be used for your cases.

Additionally the else statement here captures all other cases of subStr, not necessarily when it is an `Event`. If new requirements come in and there are new type of `Task`, the developer might forget to update the logic here and the new type of `Task` will automatically fall into the else case and treated like an `Event`.

The default case in a switch statement could be used to catch invalid cases. I believe the default case is optional in Java
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/switch-statement-in-java/

The style guide suggests that
```
Always include a default branch in case statements.

Furthermore, use it for the intended default action and not just to execute the last option. If there is no default action, you can use the default branch to detect errors (i.e. if execution reached the default branch, raise a suitable error). This also applies to the final else of an if-else construct. That is, the final else should mean 'everything else', and not the final option. Do not use else when an if condition can be explicitly specified, unless there is absolutely no other possibility.
```

Perhaps a switch statement here would help to improve readability or you could modify the code by splitting the string by the empty character delimiter twice so you don't have to do another `if` inside the external `if`

Maybe your InvalidCommand can be an exception, and your doneCommand can throw the exception so you don't have to do all the checking within this method which could make the code easier to read

There are many Javadocs missing, it would be good to write header comments for all public classes and methods see [here](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html#comments)

It might also be good to be consistent with the number of new lines at the end of your files rather than no or dangling new lines. I believe it is good to have a single new line at the end.

There are several places where `System.out.println` was directly used, possibly violating the abstraction from `Ui.printMessage` (I guess this might not really matter once you start implementing the GUI, you wouldn't be able to use `System.out.println` to directly print to your UI)

(Also a general comment for your other command classes:)

I understand that by `AddCommand` you are referring to "a command by the user to add some task"; perhaps consider using something like `AddTaskCommand` as the class name instead to make it clear that you are specifying "some class to represent commands to add tasks" instead of "some class to add some commands".

The code in the `Deadline` and `Event` cases are very similar hence I think you could combine both into one case; alternatively, assuming all `taskType` inputs are valid, consider the `ToDo` case first and let the `Deadline` and `Event` be the default. To account for the 'by' and 'at' issue, maybe you can define an auxiliary delimiter string, if event then the string is 'at', else 'by'. This might help significantly reduce code duplication 👍🏼

Should these error messages be abstracted into final Strings so that they can be easily modified when the errors are thrown? For example, you could consider having methods in the '''DukeException''' class to return a '''DukeException''' instance with a specific type of error message:

'''java
public class DukeException extends Exception {
    public DukeException(String message) {
      super(message);
    }
    //...
    public static final String EMPTY_DESC_ERROR = "Empty description error!";
    //...
    public static DukeException emptyDescError() {
      return new DukeException(EMPTY_DESC_ERROR);
    }
}
'''
Then, throw the exception with
'''throw DukeException.emptyDescError();'''

LGTM, though I did noticed some minor coding standard violations. I'm impressed at how indepth your Javadoc comments are, and how you managed to abstract many functions of the program into methods.

This function seems to be essentially equivalent to `execute` other than the fact that it has a `String` return type. Was there any specific reason why you chose to have a separate abstract function, rather than to change the return type of `execute` and return empty/null strings if there is no response?

Looking at the classes that extend from `Command`, it seems that this has led to multiple [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) violations. I think reworking your codebase to have just the `execute` method would be beneficial for code quality.

Well written code in general. Not sure if it's necessary but I think it's okay to include `@author` and `@version` into the class headers. Also, all your exceptions seem to print the same message. Perhaps you can consider `@Overriding` the `getMessage` method and replace it with a more relevant error message! Overall, good job. 😄

Maybe you want to consider abstracting out the process of throwing the DukeException for the description of a certain task being empty?

If it's storing only the date then the naming should be fine but if it's storing both the date and time, then the naming can be changed to something like &gt;code>atDateTime&gt;/code> to make it more obvious. 🤔

I really like the way of organizing all the messages in a different class. Maybe you can also make use of Java enum here something like this. This is the way I have organized my messages.

Perhaps it's better to have customized classes for different kinds of exceptions, thereby customizing the exception message for each class. Then in the lines below you won't need to check if the exception message is equal to some message and then print out something else; instead you just need to throw an instance of that specific class of customized exception and the corresponding message can also be displayed.

If you decide to make a Task mutable, remove `final` from these variables. Also, I think these should be `private` to the `Task` class, and shouldn't be accessible within the class (perhaps have a getter class to return these values).

Personally, I think the case branch below is too long which makes the entire method looks unsightly and hard to read. Perhaps consider putting it into another method such as:

I believe it's better to add the ```//Fallthrough``` comment whenever there is a ```case``` statement without a ```break``` statement. 
It helps to make clear that this is intentional and not by accident :smile: 
Example:
```javascript
switch (condition) {
case ABC:
    statements;
    // Fallthrough
case DEF:
    statements;
    break;

Generally, the minor coding violations mentioned have been fixed and the separation of large chunks of code makes it much cleaner. However, the parse method's functionality may not be immediately clear so I feel an additional description there would help, and descriptions for test methods would be good too. Other than that, LGTM :smiley:

The explicit `//Fallthrough` comment should be included whenever there is a `case` statement without a break statement. It helps to make clear that this is intentional and not by accident.

The javadoc comment should have an empty line between the description and parameter section. Punctuation should also be behind each parameter description as well.

Example:
```java
/**

 * If the position is unset, NaN is returned.
 *
 * @param x  X coordinate of position.
 * @param y Y coordinate of position.
 * @param zone Zone of position.
 * @return Lateral location.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException  If zone is <= 0.

Overall very few coding standard violations, except for those that was mentioned.
Also, I think you can add gradle files to gitignore, if im not wrong.
Other than that that looks good to me

Maybe condense or split the function into smaller chunks since the coding guidelines recommend to avoid long methods (less than 30 LOC) [reference](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/codeQuality.html#avoid-long-methods)

Perhaps you can extract out certain sections of the code such as the constants for printAddTask to a variable outside the method since the method is too long and according to the coding standards here methods should not be longer than 30 LOC [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/codeQuality.html#avoid-long-methods)

Overall good job with the iP so far! The code is pretty clean but could do with some touchups such as being consistent with choosing to use periods or not in JavaDoc comments or some lines being quite long (close to 120 but not exceeding), making it slightly hard to read!

Just a suggestion: this part of your control flow logic could be placed in an abstract `Task` class. `Task` could have a static factory method that checks the type of task to create then creates the necessary type. That should help in making this `parse` method shorter!

Aside from these two nits, LGTM! I thought it was interesting that you used enums to separate out the messages for each command -- but also had individual classes for each command. Since each enum is only used in one place, I'm curious about why you didn't just include it as a string within each command. All the best!

A client who uses this class does not need to know that the method is abstract. A subclass of `Command` would know it is abstract, otherwise the code will not compile.

[Here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/swing/Action.html) is an example from Java 11 API. Notice that `getValue(String key)` is listed under abstract methods, but its Javadoc does not mention anything about it being `abstract`.

Good job on following the coding standard! I couldn't find many violations to comment on. One small thing I guess you can pay more attention to is the parameter description for comments. Make sure to end each description with a punctuation. It's not necessary to align one parameter description with others, and starting the description with a capitalize letter might also make it neater.  Overall, your code was very nice and easy to read~ well done :))

I think your coding quality is quite good:) There's not a lot to comment about variable or methods names. Each line of your code is also quite short and clear too. Perhaps you can make several methods shorter to make it even better. Overall well done!!

I agree, This expression might be confusing to people trying to understand your code.
Maybe you can replace it with:
```
private boolean isInvalidIndex(int index) {
    int size = getSize();
    if (size == -1) {
        return false;
    } else if (index >= size || index < 0) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

Hello!! After looking through your code, I found very little coding standard violations, and I also liked how everything was neatly packaged into different classes (e.g. the Command subclasses). I do think that adding some comments (especially for more complicated parts such as your parse() method) would greatly help both you and others reading your code to understand and spot potential errors. All in all, great job!

This is perfectly valid, but I think it would be better to trim the input once beforehand then compare to the three cases:

```

String trimmedInput = input.trim();
if (trimmedInput.equals("todo") || trimmedInput.equals("deadline") || trimmedInput.equals("event")) {

Very neat and easily readable code, follows coding standards closely generally except for some tiny spacing/indentation errors here and there. Methods and variables are named appropriately.

Everything looks neat and readable, cannot find any major coding standards violations. Maybe you can add javadocs for all public classes and methods so that others reading your code can easily understand what everything does at one glance. Also, consider naming your packages `duke.task`, `duke.command` etc. instead of `tasks`, `commands`.

Maybe you can split it into 2 methods? The first one could be a `void` method `runCommand` that just runs the command, and at the end you decide whether you continue running it using a `boolean` method `canContinue`.

LGTM 👍 The use of abstract classes for commands and tasks is good, and it is great that you have considered and implemented multiple types of errors/exceptions, but do keep in mind that you have a manageable number of classes/files to work on!

The rest that are suggested would simply be cosmetic changes, as your code looks pretty short (not over 30 lines for function declarations other than switch statements) and avoids using deep nesting.

LGTM! I couldn't find any other coding standard violation other than the JavaDoc one. Overall the code is very well written and easy to navigate, but I agree with @jackgugz that the use of Enums, Optionals and Streams can be difficult to understand for inexperienced coders so would be good to have comments describing whats going on.
Good job!

Generally speaking, function descriptors should be more specific and more detailed, unless the function is a very generic one such as getters and setters. I would recommend adding in more details such as what purpose exactly do run do, perhaps 2 to 3 lines will do?

This two seems like mutually exclusive events, perhaps you could use if else to connect them? 
For example, you could create the splitArgs array at the start. Then if splitArgs[0].equals(""), give first message, else if splitArgs.length &gt; 2, give second message. 

I personally recommend avoid single if statements recurring in one function, as you may missed out certain logically flaws that the current if condition could not catch, but could lead to runtime exceptions.

I would recommend a comment above this function as its seems to be quite a key function for this class. Perhaps just a simple description? I had a similar logic in my own work and I had to update my write-alike function several times as I keep updating the input format.

So perhaps it would be better to have a function descriptor for it?

I think that it would be better to avoid the setters as it would reduce the point of having a private tasklist. 
I personally prefer to only allow the private attributes be modified only via the public methods provided by the wrapper class. For example in this case I only allow the tasklist to be modified by the add and deleteTask functions, whereas the getter will create a new arraylist and copy the private tasklist over, so as to return this copy instead of the actual tasklist. 
This is prevent others from modifying the tasklist at will, which could lead to runtime exceptions

Maybe you want to install the checkstyle into your gradle package? I ran it on your files and it came up with 187 errors. Although most of them are minor things, there are multiple instances of coding standards violation like this where the variable names are not actually camelCase. Since your codebase is actually quite large automated checkstyle can probably help reduce such errors!

Overall I think your iP generally works well! I like that you have thoroughly documented your work which makes it easy to see what your functions do.

Some suggestions I can give is that you could perhaps add more error detection (e.g event crashes when I type `event test /at ` or `deadline test`). Your code didn't seem to have too major coding standard violations but I seen quite a few commented out imports and multiple empty lines in your code. You can consider downloading the checkstyle plugin/setup checkstyle for gradle to iron out your code to make it look nicer!

You did most of your parsing in the Command classes. The Command classes should only be concerned about managing the task list, storage and the UI.

These two public static methods should be documented to explain their uses. I don't really see the benefit of having two static methods to get the different type of dialog boxes and it complicates your architecture unnecessarily. You can have a simple public constructor with an extra boolean parameter such as fromDuke(true if Duke's response, false if user input). Then, the constructor can handle the logic of the orientation

Well done! I can't really find any major code quality violations. I believe that once you start working on `A-checkstyle`, it will show you all the small little errors and warnings that I can't possibly spot manually, and ask you to correct them. Keep up with the great work 👍

Keep up with the good work! Just some minor suggestions wrt to the coding standard 😄

Some other side notes unrelated to coding conventions:
1. I can't see the Javadocs from Github, not sure if you don't have them yet or Github does not display it.
1. Avoid arrowhead code style (e.g. you can extract out the first `if` in `deleteTask()` as `if (... &gt;= 0) { throw ... }`)
1. You can try using `checkstyle` as it will point you all the places that violates any rules according to a set of rules defined by `checkstyle.xml`

In the code quality guidelines [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/codeQuality.html#guideline-name-well) under naming section, theres this line that says "Use __nouns__ for classes/variables and verbs for methods/functions".

Looks great, but java imports should be in lexographical order and could show up as checkstyle errors later. Perhaps it could be rearranged in this order:
```
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;

Maybe it would be better to not use [numbers or case](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/codeQuality.html) such as `toAdd3` to distinguish names?

Variable `s` seems to have a large enough scope - it could have a longer, more descriptive name? I saw a similar naming for the `BufferedReader` variable  `b` above as well.

Maybe you should specify the InvalidInputExcetion thrown in the constructor signature? Since it is not being caught and handled inside the constructor itself.

```java
private Deadline(String taskName, Boolean isDone) throws InvalidInputException {
    // ...
}

Minor point here, but I felt that the name `findMatchingTasks` might be better written as `findTasksThatMatchKeyword`. This is because `findMatchingTasks` makes me think that the code will find and group `Task`s based on their similarities, instead of a method that queries for `Task`s based on a given String.

Unless I am misunderstanding your code, if you leave it as `input.contains("todo")`, wouldn't there be a bug where the user types, for example, "bla bla todo homework"? The if-condition is fulfilled, but the outcome might not be as expected. Same for other else if statements below.

Overall your code was easy to read. There were a few minor coding standard violations here and there. I did feel that in certain files such as Duke.java, there were lots of empty lines which were placed to help improve readability, but I personally felt it unnecessarily elongated the code, which made it harder to read. Maybe you could also consider removing certain empty lines if you feel they are not essential?

Perhaps remove the indentation in the switch statement, as there should be no indentation for `case` clauses. 

One useful way is to configure Intellij's settings so they can handle this indentation for you. Go to `Settings > Editor > Code Style > Java`, select tab `Wrapping and Braces`, scroll down the list to `switch` statement, uncheck the option `Indent 'case' branches`.

LGTM! The code generally follows all the coding standards and is written very neatly and cleanly. The only issues I could find were probably just the ones related to making all your method names verbs when necessary (feel free to correct me also, I'm not sure if I'm 100% correct also haha), but overall, the code looks really good! :)

Hi Dillion,

I think that your components of the projects are nicely abstracted. It is easy to follow the read and understand the processes. There are only a few coding standards violations and all of them are really minor issues.  
I also really like the comprehensive testing you have done. Nicely done and all the best! 😄

I agree with Gabriel's suggestion. Since the isExit() function only deals with one property (true/false for whether the program is running), and every command has this property, perhaps it's better to convert it into a variable?

It's interesting that you let SaberException extend RuntimeException. Please correct me if I'm wrong, yet I thought that RuntimeException are unchecked exceptions, which happen because of bad programming / programmers' fault. On the other hand, exceptions that occur due to user's faults (like invalid input, file not found etc.) are checked exceptions (which can happen even if the programmer did everything correctly).

I thought that what SaberException deals with is more like checked exceptions, where you programmed perfectly, yet users may do silly things like missing arguments. 

Just a thought. Maybe you can give more clarifications?

I like how you considered all possible exceptions, and listed them out as classes extending SaberException. However, as an optional personal opinion, I see that each subclass exception only uses the super constructor, and doesn't have its own special behavior; thus perhaps you can replace all subclass exceptions with SaberException itself, and just type in different (specialized) error messages? 

In this way, you only need to catch one big SaberException at the end of everything, and print out its specialized error message, which would tell the user what's wrong all the same. Then you don't need to have lots of different exception classes, and don't need to have catch block for them all. Could make your code clearer.

Just a personal opinion though. There's nothing wrong listing out each exception as a subclass.

The code looks great! But one thing that caught my eyes were the boolean EXIT which kept on appearing at different parts of the code. Maybe its usage can be unified in some way so that EXIT does not have to be repeated. Overall the code really is great!

Good job overall! Just one thing to take note of: try to use small and simple functions to handle your complex logic, don't put everything into one function. It makes readers confusing and it is also hard to do unit testing~
