Hi prof,

For Q2, I assume AB3 is not part of the reusing that this question is intended to ask, since all our tPs are based on it?

As written in the title, my [PR](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/219) is failing at the Codecov step. All I did in this PR is updating of the team's UG only

The link to the CI is [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/runs/3998154253?check_suite_focus=true)

Tried re-run the jobs like 3 times, still same results. Not sure if just Codecov decided to fail tonight. I'm re running again and see if it changes tomorrow.

Recently due to updating of code for v1.2, our code starts to fail CI. Now that we fixed it and it is passing CI, the Codecov does not seem to appear anymore. This is what was shown on the [Codecov ](https://app.codecov.io/gh/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/) side

Anything we can do to fix the issue and let Codecov leave a comment on the PR again?

<panel  header="**4. :fas-info-circle: Java Pattern Regex**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/286" expanded>

Hi guys can anyone explain what this code means? What is this supposed to match?

``` java
Pattern.compile("(?<arg1>\\S+)(?<arg2>.*)");
```

From tests and trials, I observed:

Given input: `abc de fgh...`

`arg1` = `abc`
`arg2` = `de fgh...`

What I wanted to do is to split it further into 3 parts and obtain the following results.

`arg1` = `abc`
`arg2` = `de`
`arg3` = `fgh...`

The way how I currently did is to use the Pattern again on arg2 to separate out arg3, but I wonder if there is a more elegant way to tweak the Pattern somehow and give all 3 args in 1 shot.

<panel  header="**5. :fas-info-circle: UML Diagram - Alternative Paths**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/281" expanded>

Following the [website](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/uml.html#alternative-paths), I do not see any restrictions of having just 1 alt path.

It is also mentioned that
> That is, it is acceptable for none of the alternative partitions to be executed but it is not acceptable for multiple partitions to be executed.

So is it possible for `alt` box to have just 1 condition, acting the same way as `opt`?

<panel  header="**6. :fas-info-circle: GitHub Table**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/267" expanded>

From the Markdown guide, I see that we create a table in the following way
```
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content      | Content
```

My question is what if the `Content` is very long? I'm not sure if the 120 characters limit applies here, but I find it hard to read and edit anyways.

Example 1:

```
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content      | Super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super long text
```

Below is the output of it, which GitHub automatically made it into 2 lines.

Output of Example 1:

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content      | Super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super long text

But is there a way to write it such that I can add newlines yet keeping it in the same box? Like in my editor I can type the following, and still displaying as it is on top.

Example 2:

```
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content      | Super super super super super super super super super super super super 
             | super super super super super super super super super super super super 
             | super super super super super super super super super super long text
```

Currently typing this way result in the following output, which is not what I wanted

Output of Example 2:

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content      | Super super super super super super super super super super super super 
             | super super super super super super super super super super super super 
             | super super super super super super super super super super long text

I tried to add `|` in front also which turn into this

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content      | Super super super super super super super super super super super super 
|             | super super super super super super super super super super super super

I had previously used `streams` in my code already so what should I do for this level? I noticed that if I make a branch but no edits, I can't make a pull request to my own repo? Is this the case or did I do something wrong in my steps.

Steps I did:

1. Open SourseTree & branch from master
1. Right click `branch-A-Streams` and select `Create pull request...`
1. Redirects me to the website

1. Change base repo to my own

1. The `Create pull request` part disappeared

Can I just add a branch and add a tag for this level if there is nothing to do?

<panel  header="**8. :fas-info-circle: A-Assertions**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/177" expanded>

I have attempted this and found out that `assert` throws an `AssertionException`, and this causes errors in my unit testing as I expect my own exceptions (the `DukeException` that we made) to be thrown.

Any tips on what to do in this case? Such as making gradle's test to ignore `AssertionException`?

From the notes it mentioned that `assert` is __disabled__ by default on `java` and we need to use a `-ea` flag to activate it so I wonder if it is the same case for testing? Or should I just remove those `assert` that interferes with my own exception throwing?

Also, any suggestions on how many `assert` to add? Or this level is just to let us get familiar with it so any number is ok?

Following the tutorial, it asks us to use JavaFX 11. However, SceneBuilder seems to be using JavaFX 16 instead, and hence always shows a lot of warning messages when I run my program.

Currently I found a fix which is to manually edit the fxml files generated by ScnenBuilder to switch it to JavaFX 11. Is there any easier way such as telling SceneBuilder to use JavaFX11 instead? Or can we use JavaFX 16 in our project?

So after completing the GUI I thought it will be nice to have a jar file for it. So I ran the `shadowJar` function in gradle but the jar file it produced does not work. The program is able to run on Intelij, and shadowJar is able to work when I disabled the GUI.

As the screenshot suggests, somehow `shadowJar` did not pack my `javafx` stuffs into the `jar` file? Any fix for this?

I have already commited but all I wrote for the commit message is just "Level X completed". I'm new to using soursetree so I thought the message is just to tell myself what the commit is about. Also I tend to only commit once for each level is that supposed to be the case?

But if we tweak the command format will the auto grader still works? Say if we change the format from `deadline xxx /by yyy` to `deadline xxx /at yyy`, later the auto grader inputs `deadline xxx /by yyy` format and we return the bot a `Sorry I don't know the command` etc.

If you are afraid of this then one way you can do is probably add a `Main.java` to hold that `main()` function which calls
`new Duke()`. But as far as I know this is fine, with the variables set to `private`. Constructor can be left `public` actually.

Erm I just realised that it is actually inefficient for you to keep calling `.indexOf(x)` as it is O(n) time complexity. Perhaps a for loop is better, I forgot that you have to put the task number at the front.

I tried using cmd also but it's the same results. From what I recall i think there is a way to call `javac` on the `.java` files in the subdirectories also right? I believe the issue here is just that only `Duke.java` is being processed and hence it can't find the other files/classes

I would say that's the easy way, which is wut I did, is to just overwrite the file. Imo, the more efficient way is to only write to the file before the program ends, whether normally or due to some exceptions.

I'm not sure if there is a way to just remove some lines from a text file, most of the time people would just read the file and filter the list and output it.

I believe you are testing for the load and save function. What I did is that I have a `data.txt` which is already filled with some stuff to test my `load()`, after which follows normal testing and lastly, delete all tasks in the list (can also test delete during this time) and add back the tasks that was initially in `data.txt`.

Hence if my `store()` is working correctly, the 2nd round of script should still show `no diff` for `FC`. (sadly u still need to run the script manually)

Update: actually now I thought again, why not duplicate the content of the script so it runs twice?

`dir /s /B  ../src/main/java/*/*.java` didnt work for me I had to do it the other way sadly. Also, using `dir` gives the absolute path which `javac` cannot use if it contains `space bar` if im not wrong. Can also refer to mine if you face the same issue as me #52.

Firstly, I think your method is not returning if an exception is thrown
```
public String getKeyword() {
        try {
            if (this.cmdString.length() < 6) throw new InvalidInputException();
            if (this.cmdString.substring(5).trim().length() == 0) throw new InvalidInputException();
            **return this.cmdString.substring(5).trim();**
        } catch (InvalidInputException e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }

    // Here
    }
```
So if any errors are thrown, the catch part will be executed. And then the program proceeds to the part marks `Here`, so you still need a `return` statement there I suppose. You can try this out.

Usually when I want to handle the error in the current function, I will use a `try... catch...`, but if I wan the parent function (the function that calls `getKeyword()`) to handle that error, use the `public String getKeyword() throw Exception`.

From my experience working in a small 2 people group project, we discussed the main features that are to implement and together, we come up with a `Main` first. The `Main` will handle all the transitions between the methods and stuffs. From there on, we try to develop features to add on to `Main`, but are independent of existing features. In another word, we try to split the work such that we do not need to resolve major merge conflicts. The only conflicts that can possibly arise is in `Main`

My experience with the given gradle is just merge it to my main and change the `mainclass`, which you showed, and it works just fine. In my case, my `main` is in `Duke.java` which is `src/main/java/duke/Duke`, and i set it to `mainclass = 'duke.Duke'`

I looked at your `UI.java`, it is almost the same as mine and mine is working so yours should be as well. Hence I looked at ur `Duke.java`. I see that in your `run()`, you have your input outside the while loop at line 44. Not sure if that is the cause but maybe you can try to do this?

Thanks for the reply, it works!

Regarding this, 
> does show that it is necessary to create an additional `Launcher` class to avoid any circular dependencies

I did not see in the docs that a `Launcher` class is required to avoid circular dependencies tho. Maybe you are referring to the comment `A launcher class to workaround classpath issues.`? Not sure what exactly is a `classpath issue`.

I thought that my `Main` can just call the `main` method to launch the app. Maybe it is because `Main.main()` calls `launch` which in turn call another `new Main()`, hence the circular dependencies? This also explains why we need to just create an empty constructor for people have the other issues?

Also I think when I copied the `.xml` files from AB3 both showed some errors and I had to resolve them first before my checkstyle can run. Perhaps take a look into the 2 `.xml` files and see if Intelij shows any errors? The part that show error for me is line 3-4.

I think I did not change the checkstyle much apart from small changes to the rules and auto formatting done by Intelij. But glad that it works.

Things I changed:

1. Change `ignoreFinal` from `false` to `true` to allow constant variable to be named with all caps
``` xml
&gt;!-- Validate abbreviations (consecutive capital letters) length in identifier name -->
		<module name = "AbbreviationAsWordInName">
			<property name = "ignoreFinal" value = "true"/>
			<property name = "allowedAbbreviationLength" value = "1"/>
		</module>
```

2. Remove check for `(` as it affects lambda expressions `() -&gt; ...`
``` xml
<module name = "SeparatorWrap">
			&gt;!-- Checks that the ",", "]", "[", "...", ";" is at the previous end of line in a line wrap. -->
			<property name = "tokens" value = "COMMA, RBRACK, ARRAY_DECLARATOR, ELLIPSIS, SEMI"/>

But if my code pretty much handled all the cases I can think of, what should I put for `assert`? Should I use `assert` to double check that my code indeed handled all the cases?

Can't really find some places to insert `assert` as most of the places Intelij will highlight it as `unreachable code` or `the boolean is always true` kind of stuffs due to `exception` handling the cases, but I managed to put it somewhere in my codes... I hope they are fine with just 1 `assert`...

That's an interesting idea. What I put in my code currently is to ensure that the list of tasks to be saved to local storage cannot be `null`, although inside my code this technically will never happen. I guess I'm treating `assert` as some ways to double check.

You can take a look at my code, under `sora.task.Task`. I also did `C-Sort`. It can give you a better idea what exactly you should do. I used the exact way as you wanted, 1 single generic `compareTo(Task t)`.

If they are optional, you can add a method which returns a dummy value if they do not have time stored. Then u can still use the generic style.

Didn't look at your code so I'm not sure what is your situation exactly. I've just updated my code to be cleaner in a sense that my `compareTo` is now much shorter. You can take a look at it again [here](https://github.com/SkyBlaise99/ip/blob/master/src/main/java/sora/task/Task.java#L84) and maybe it is what you needed.

In my case I'm comparing 2 `Tasks` objects. `Task` has this abstarct method called `extractDateTime()` which runs depending on how the child class implements it.

Text ui testing may not be applicable if you have not update the input.txt and expected.txt in them. Also packaging will cause an error in the scripts if you do not change them.

I guess in a sense, accepting a pull request is like performing a merge branch on GitHub. Hence after the operation and resolving merge conflicts, the things from the pull request are merged into your master (or other branch you merging to). Hence in SourceTree it shows as if you performed a merge branch.

Personally, after I accept my pull request, my SourceTree updates to some what similar to yours after I call for a pull request on my master to see the update.

I think it is better to have it as a separate `enum class`. Perhaps in the future, when you may want to use it in another class, then it saves the trouble to shift it out again. Ultimately, it is up to you to decide. You can hide it within the current file as a `private enum` if you do not want other class to be able to 'see' it / as a form of abstraction.

You can take a look at #314 the post by @pss-coder for automatically `adding line breaks at EOF` in Intellij. Intellij also offers a way to automatically `remove trailing whitespace` in `formatting` options. And all these can be linked to save by enabling `format on save` option

I think it could be due to these lines in your build.gradle
```
    implementation 'junit:junit:4.12'
    implementation 'org.testng:testng:7.1.0'

Once I remove them from your build.gradle, it is able to get the test files (even though it says all the junit test are not found).

Update:
I think your test statement imports are wrong. They should be

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

I think fields can be non-finals. However, in the case of command, the class should be immutable to prevent the value from changing. This is so that you can pass the command instance around freely without having to remember whether a method you pass them to could change them in a way your code is not prepared to handle. Afterall, the commands will be passed through multiple methods and this might cause some unintended effect.

> > adding or replacing a new object in the underlying list
> 
> I see can I clarify the meaning of underlying list, does it refer to the list in the model manager or the list in the addressbook or somewhere deeper?

For ab3, if you trace through the codes, you will realize that the order goes like this:
1. MainWindow.java gets filtered list from Logic.java
2. LogicManager gets the filtered list from Model.java
3. ModelManager returns a filtered list that is stored in it. But how about the data in the filtered list? ModelManger got the innner list from AddressBook.java
4. AddressBook return UniquePersonList.asUnmodifiableObservableList()
5. Now, this unmodifiable observable list comes from the internalList in UniquePersonList.java

So, you can see that the `filteredList` has a `UnmodifiableObservableList`. This `UnmodifiableObservableList` will update whenever the `internalList` updates. This update will kinda update the `filteredList` and the UI will show it up. 

I dont really know exactly how this FilteredList and ObservableList works but thats how AB3 updates the UI

FilteredList and ObservableList is different. FilteredList is not able to be modified, neither is UnmodifiableObservableList. However, you can modify ObservableList. For ab3, its in the UniquePersonList class

Hi all, I am unable to see the AB3 save file in the directory that the AB3.jar is located in as explained by [this guide](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/UserGuide.html#saving-the-data) 

I have turned on hidden files and even tried to check the contents of the jar using `jar -tf addressbook.jar | grep -r addressbook.json` and couldn't get anything.

Hi all, just wanted to check if it is necessary to test functions that are inherited from a super class. IMO it makes sense to just test the super class, and if it fails, we should expect the same test to fail for the child class(therefore unnecessary). The exception to this is if the child class overrides this method, and since it differs from its parent, should also be tested.

I have 2 branches A and B. I have worked on branch A making commits to it and finished a feature. I am now on branch B, where I realised some of the files on branch A share identical logic which I can just copy over. How can I bring over certain lines for these files? 

From what I understand, cherrypicking in git is for whole commits, but since branch B only requires  **specific code** in **specific files** I am not sure what is a good way to do this.

For more context this is because, level-7 introduces a subclass that level-8 can use ! And just copy pasting it over feels wrong

Hi all, adding new tasks to the data file is a simple write with an append option to a file. Whilst an operation like delete or complete task requires you to somehow search the file and amend/ delete the line.

One way I could think of is to rewrite the whole file with all the tasks that are still in the list when delete/ complete a task is called, but this seems to inefficient. Thoughts?

Should we immediately be encapsulating methods that are related into a class? I have just completed Level-2 of the iP and logic for the ToDo list is in the main function.

This is interesting and unexpected. The temp file is committed sometime in the past(we shall call this point A) and only ignored later(Point B), so git doesn't use the .gitignore at Point A and show the temp file at Point A? So only the latest .gitignore file is always used when checking out files?

If it is your most recent commit, you can try `git commit --amend  &gt;Newmessage>` or `git commit --amend` if you want to open an editor to write the message.

I am not too sure for older commits, but I think using Intellij or SourceTree would be easier for much older commits

Hi ricky, I did a quick search and found the following

1. 
> branch.*.remote configuration for the current branch is consulted to determine where to push. If the configuration is missing, it defaults to origin.

Git push origin is more specific and I am assuming would allow you to specify other branches that you would like to push to your remote repository, not necessarily the branch you are currently on.
[git push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) 

2. When you clone a repository, the repo that you clone from would be added as a remote repo and for convenience be named as origin for a shorthand. Therefore at this point, in the mod, we would usually be working with origin as we are working on our own repo. 
Use `git remote -v` to see the link between the shorthand "origin" and the URL of your repo

[git clone](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-clone#:~:text=git%20clone%20is%20primarily%20used,copies%20an%20existing%20Git%20repository.)

@huizhuansam Will check it out!

@SkyBlaise99 I think for this iP that would be the obvious choice, but this will probably me more applicable if the code implemented in A was a major feature that is not ready to be merged with B, especially since I only need some common code from A to be in B and not all of it.

@sueann-chua Not really following this thread but for git branching, including the -b flag means that you are trying to create a branch and then perform a checkout. I am assuming you are trying to checkout an existing branch so use

Hi Jia Rong, from the sounds of it you have merged add-gradle-support into your branch.

Do you have a package called seedu? Since the build.gradle file was meant to have a package structure `seedu > duke > Duke`, if you don't follow this it would cause an error.

Could you check your `<project root dir>/build.gradle` and under `application`change `mainClassName`to somePackage.another.Mainclass. I have included an example below.

@waynetee My current implementation implements the methods directly into the commands as I find a solution to this. 

Because of the same method signature and return type of the getSyntax method, I thought it would be better to put it in the parent class to ensure that future commands are checked by the compiler to ensure the method is implemented.

Ok I think this is the cause of the problem. You are making a shallow copy of taskList, this means that all your taskLists are pointed to the same arrayList instance.

for example:
ArrayList: [ElemA, ElemB, ElemC]

taskList -&gt; ArrayList -&gt; [ElemA, ElemB, ElemC]
taskListCpy -&gt; ArrayList -&gt; [ElemA, ElemB, ElemC]  (Which is the same 3 elments!)

if I do taskListCpy delete index 2
taskListCpy -&gt; ArrayList -&gt; [ElemA, ElemB] 
taskList -&gt; ArrayList -&gt; [ElemA, ElemB]


Solution: Make a deep copy! Do something like a for loop that create new instances of each task in the taskList and return a new taskList

Yours seems to be using a https remote

Hi I am assuming that you tried to a fresh clone of your repo using the SSH command `git clone git@github.com:wangpeialex/tp.git`

Can you try and follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to make sure that you have configured your SSH for git correctly?

You can check out the  [Intellij auto import](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-optimizing-imports.html#automatically-add-import-statements). After configuring, deleting the offending import statements should automatically be reimported, unless there are a few classes/ variables that have a similar name. 

If it is ambiguous there is some manual work, where you can look at the context actions for the missing classes and reimport using keyboard shortcuts (check out the same link, first section)

@s7u4rt99   Did you set the environment variables JAVA_HOME and JDK_HOME to `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11.jdk/Contents/Home`.

Does `whereis java` and `which java` give you ` /usr/bin/java` as mentioned above? Also sounds kinda silly, but maybe try restart your computer. Else I'm not too sure either sorry!

correct me if wrong, just like final int[] arr = {1,1,1}, you can still modify the element in the array, but you can't assign a new array {1,2,2} to arr since arr is final. so storage is ok to be final

It's pretty interesting that you are running this on wsl.

I suspect it's hard for intelij to pipe your input all the way to the wsl process.

Perhaps you can try `./gradlew run` on the wsl terminal and see if it works.

Later on, you might run into further problems when you start adding a gui on wsl.

Unless you are confident to proceed, can I suggest you use windows instead? Perhaps this would be the easier way out. :)

You can remove the stroke related properties you are not using.

As a general tip, to debug performance-related issues, you can try to binary search the bug. Delete half your code or half the fxml file and see if the issue persists, then continue to narrow down the search range until you find the exact location of the issue.

I believe you need the branch, pushing the tag wont be enough. The marking script seems to checking for the branch in this case. 
If you havent committed yet, I think you can still check out now to a new branch without much issue. 

(Also, I think if you just create the branch after the changes, should be good enough to pass the marking script)

I think its just more to confirm some stuff. Maybe you can change some void functions to return true or false to indicate if it is executed correctly. Not very sure if this is advisable though.

Otherwise, you can use overloading to implement compareTask function in task. 
 
Ie. have compareTask(Event, Deadline) and compareTask(Deadline, Deadline) etc. 
So if its Event vs Deadline then you compare the time. 
If its Todo vs Deadline then you just return toDo. 

Still think @XXJJXJ's solution is the best haha. Since you have to implement for many different permutations and if another class of Task is added you have to add even more. 

By the way, you can't use generics for this since it's meant for things like ArrayList Hashmap and so on. Maybe you are thinking about how Event are subclass of Task and hence can be passed into the function that takes in Task. 😄

I don't think we should be asserting trivial stuff but the above may not be minor if there's a chance that your code will actually result in passing null to add. If there isn't then perhaps its a bit unecessary. 

I actually used assert for my filemanager, if the way the file was formatted was actually different from what is expected. This would be a genuine error on my part for not loading the file properly and hence assertions were quite useful here. 😄 Hopefully this helps!

Mmmm if we are following CS2030s way, I think a better way would be to use a "of" static method to check if the input is valid before passing it into the constructor. 

I guess you don't want to add things or initialise stuff before realising the following steps will throw exceptions. Not very sure though haha.

@SkyBlaise99 On that note, I also used assert to double check that the format of my file that tasks are saved to is right. Eg if it assumes that each task should be prefixed with its type, it will throw an error if the first word isnt a task type. Maybe this could work?

Unless you are consistently using this as a separator I don't think so. 

This means that for example your tasks are always seperated by ", " in your file saved. Then you will use it in more than one instance (when accessing it and when saving it). Then maybe it's worth replacing just in case you change it in one instance but not the other.

No idea if im sprouting nonsense but maybe you can just implement the method in the command class then inside you just assert fail? then in the other command classes you can override it? 

this kind of sacrifices the advantage of inheritance though I feel, because future programmers might not realise that you need to override until they run it. 

Alternatively, just give up on the static part HAHAHA

Why is `spanner:StockItem` considered also correct in this case? From what I understand from the code provided, there is no StockItem object created with the name "spanner". I would think there is a difference between attribute names and object names, but hope someone could clarify. Thank you!

Seems quite unlikely that your com will die so badly that your commits/changes would not be saved (unless maybe you lose your com or it gets stolen). But if you're worried maybe create a branch (e.g. "work-in-progress") for you to dump the changes you've made so far?

Raising this issue to see if there are good ways to implement the following:

I'm trying to implement sort functionality by adding a `compareTo` method in my `Task` class. Inside this method, I saw duplicated code for my `Event` and `Deadline` classes and tried to extract this out to a `compareDateTime` method.

The issue is that instance variables `date` /`time` are specific to `Event`/`Deadline` classes only and not to `Task` and therefore casting is needed. But I'm not sure how to do this :(

Using generics crossed my mind, but my 2030S knowledge has failed me in my hour of need 😫

> TLDR: `compareDateTime` accepts either 2 `Event` or `Deadline` objects. They need to be cast accordingly to access their variables.

I agree. If I understand right, for a fast forward merge to occur, the latest commit of the branch being merged into must be an ancestor in the history of the other branch. 
Since `C4` is a new commit on `master` not within the history of `coolfeature` branch, this should a rebasing.

A quick google search shows that developers in general seem to be divided on this haha. One possible reason for using the imperative tense is that from the POV of a code reviewer/approver, the message will imply what will happen after merge.

I'm shifting towards the imperative, because it helps me keep it short and be more precise. Regardless of what you like, I think what's important is to maintain consistency in tense within a project.

Try out marcus' link, I'll just give a high level view of what needs to be done:

 - Checkout a new branch (Now both master and newbranch are at the latest commit)
 - Move the master branch pointer HEAD back by n commits (Now master is outdated and only newbranch has the new commits)
 - Checkout master and force push to remote (The force push is required if your remote master is already updated to the later commits)
 - Checkout newbranch, set upstream and push

I'd say it depends on factors like;
 - how long you are working on a separate branch
 - how much overlap your work will have with other developers' work (if files you are significantly changing are being significantly changed on master at the same time)
 
So far, I've found it enough to focus on my work and once the pull request is created, I will update my branch with all the latest changes from master. Yet I do keep an eye on ongoing changes to ensure no major conflicts will arise as a result of not updating my branch, and if so an occasional pull works best!

The PR would usually show this and you can update your branch then:

But its definitely better to follow @HolmesJJ advice if files you work on are more subject to frequent (significant) change on the master simultaneously.
ie. other developers are working on features involving the same files (which usually isn't the most efficient way to divide work)

@SkyBlaise99 we seem to be doing it in a very similar way haha but I've allowed Events and Deadlines to have an optional Time value. This introduces the additional chunk of duplicated code which would go inside the ternary op you used.

Its exactly like your ternary op [here](https://github.com/SkyBlaise99/ip/blob/1100320edd2a9338c3727a16d929aaf9699fdea7/src/main/java/sora/task/Task.java#L100). I just have a lot more duplicated code similar to your `.extractDateTime` call in both the consequent and alternative.

Yes, your new implementation was what I was planning to go ahead with. I'm not sure if [this](https://github.com/SkyBlaise99/ip/blob/1ac685b0f7e6b71a03f56588241af4cb8d618e8e/src/main/java/sora/task/Todo.java#L21) is a good way since I don't want my ToDo class to have anything to do with date, time.

I might also just implement `compareTo` separately in the Event and Deadline classes. Seems simpler and OOP-friendly as well.

Hi  @wengYing227,

I cloned your project and got it running by;

1. Setting `mainClassName` to `Launcher`
2. Overloading the Duke constructor with one that takes in no parameters (You can implement this as you like it though)

Let me know if you run into errors doing the above!

Sidenote: Might be a good idea to add exception handling when loading the task file :)

Hi Rishabh, 

Not exactly a solution but I've gotten this exact exception a couple of times. I usually focus on fixing the errors beneath this one, after which this does not show up (at least not yet). For example, from the snippet shown, try fixing the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` (You can select the exception and run with --scan for more details, which I found helpful).

I assume the `InvocationTargetException` is a result of exceptions propagating out of Duke to the GUI segments.

Hi,
 - I'm able to build and run your current latest version (1h ago on master) without encountering this issue, so try debugging later additions.
 - One other thing you can try (just a wild guess tbh), in case debugging the `IllegalStateException` isn't fruitful: I noticed you're running `ip.jar`, try `duke.jar` instead which should have been created along side; if I'm right this jar doesn't require specific modification of the `manifest` file as you seem to have done.

Hi Guo Rui, the issues in the screenshot provided here are not actually errors. This is the logger output when you run the testcases some of which are supposed to fail.

One thing I notice is that the path given in the error is actually `..bin/src/test/../..` and not the actual file you have open in the screenshot. This means the checkstyle seems to be running against a compiled version somehow, and I'm not sure if this is intended usage.

The `forEach` method takes a parameter of type `Consumer` . This Java interface's abstract `accept` method is not defined to throw exceptions. That should be why IntelliJ forces you to catch the thrown exception without allowing propagation. 

One way to go about this (probably overkill), is to first externally create a sub-interface (is this a word?)  of `Consumer` that overrides the `accept` method to one that can throw exceptions. Then simply type-casting your current consumer to this new interface should do it.

So I tried it out, and can get it to work if you introduce default constructors cascadingly. In the sense, don't stop at `UserInfo`; do the same for all `Mc`, `AcademicCalendar`, `AcademicYear` and `Semester`.

The downside to this seems to be that you cannot maintain the fields in these classes as `final` anymore and I'm unsure how it will affect your implementation/design. 

Also, the year provided in `TempInfo.json` has to be changed to `2` to pass the testcase as specified by the constructed `TypicalPerson`

Edit: You are allowed to initialize the variables within this default constructor maintaining them as `final`. Again, I'm unsure if such initialization will affect other parts of your codebase (though technically since this constructor is never used elsewhere, it shouldn't cause issues, but be wary xD)

Hi all,
Small doubt. When I simply click a jar file and attempt to open it, java assertions are disabled by default.
This means that one of the error handling mechanisms I have in place is not active.

however, when the jar file is opened from the terminal or command line with assertions activated, everything works fine.
is this acceptable?

Finally, I use a Mac, and I have no issues opening the jar file on my system. However, a friend of mine was unable to open the file on her computer due to her jvm being older than version 58. Is it necessary for me to do something to make the jar file compatible?

if so, what can I do?

Hi all,

I tried to reorganise my code upon the addition of gradle.
I created a test folder under <src/main> subdirectory and marked it as a test sources root.
I moved my ParserTest class to this folder from the duke package (where it was previously).

However, whenever I try to run the class, the tests do not run and a message (as seen in the screenshot) saying "No tasks available" shows. Furthermore when I try to run the tests from the gradle menu on the side, the same result is observed.

My build.gradle has the following code (which I believe is sufficient to run tests): -
```
test {
    useJUnitPlatform()

    testLogging {
        events "passed", "skipped", "failed"

Unfortunately running into a similar issue again.

```

            } else if (input.startsWith(addWhiteSpace(TODO_STRING))

The function above is for the same purpose of interpreting the user's input.
However, when I enter invalid commands, the exception is not caught (and I assume it is not thrown either).
The print statement for the variable valid always yields false when an incorrect command is entered.

Turns out the issue recurred only in my jar file.
It is working fine now. Enabling assertions from the terminal when opening the jar file allows me to see the assertion thrown. 

Just to confirm, if you click the JAR file and open the bot, you're not expected to see assertions thrown, right? Seeing as assertions are disabled by default?

Not sure what difference it would make but I tried ./gradlew shadowJar as well

Tried gradle clean before gradle shadowJar

Another thing is, now the error message is that my jar file is of version 59.0 instead of 58.0... (see picture below)

I heard the saying that you should commit whenever your software is at a stage where it is worth being remembered as a version.
But i have this question:
suppose i write a whole lot of code already for the entire day but then at the end of the day the code is   still incomplete or in need of a clean up. Should i not commit? What happens if i don't commit and then my com just suddenly dies(you never know what can happen)?  My whole day's work would be gone! 
so even if I do local commit and my com dies, it still dies with my com so to play safe i should push to remote branch every time (but then again the code currently is not exactly a version worth remembering)?

My understanding is that you can reference fxml elements from control classes, <ins>but can you also reference them from say Duke.java which is not a control class for any element.<ins>

control classes are those classes where `fxmlLoader.setController(this)`, `fxmlLoader.setRoot(this)`, etc. has been called

What i mean by reference is like calling functions to modify fxml element's properties 
e.g.
```java
//scrollPane & dialogContainer are fxml elements
scrollPane.vvalueProperty().bind(dialogContainer.heightProperty());
dialogContainer.getChildren().add(
       DialogBox.getDukeDialog("Welcome! What can i do for you?", dukeImage)

However, it seems that the input output redirection ends once the program exits after my "bye" command.

Is there any way to do what i intended?

do i have to do pull request for independent project or push directly to remote master (my own forked repo master)?
The latter sounds like an extremely bad practice, as i have heard from online forums.
Also in general i am curious about the workflow.
My current idea of what should happen is:
    1. create new branch locally
    2. after a commit on that branch, push it to a remote branch 
    3. make a pull request to master 
    4. merge into master
    5. at local master use git pull to update my local files

Is this correct? 
Can someone  enlighten me on this area in general.

@damithc  
I can't remove this version of java that is installed on my m1 mac
```
openjdk 16 2021-03-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 16+36-2231)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 16+36-2231, mixed mode, sharing)
```
I followed the video recommended by @sivayogasubramanian by deleting all current jdk in `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines`  and then installed the Azul build but when i enter
```
java --version
```
The same version above still shows up.
Any idea how to resolve this?

Additional note:
The openjdk 16 is not even in the `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines` directory

ok i found all the diff versions of jdk, they are at ` cd /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines` instead of ` cd Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines` . Deleting these versions have solved my issue. Much thanks!

What I'm doing is to read data from local json file.
I'm testing it through test cases in ```JsonUserInfoStorageTest.java```, but the error comes up and says:
``` 
Error reading from jsonFile file src\test\data\JsonUserInfoStorageTest\TempInfo.json: com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: No suitable constructor found for type [simple type, class seedu.tracker.model.calendar.AcademicCalendar]: can not instantiate from JSON object (missing default constructor or creator, or perhaps need to add/enable type information?)
```


The Json file ```TempInfo.json``` is auto written by the code successfully, but it fails to be read back.
I think the data format in TempInfo.json is incorrect for reading. Hence I guess the data format of reading and writing defined somewhere in the code are different. But I have no idea where I can modify that and make it work, cuz I'm not familiar with working with Json files.






TempInfo.json:

The whole program runs well on IDEA,
however, after I generated a jar file and double-clicked duke.jar to run the program, a problem occurs.
That is, **it neither clears the user input bar nor print the corresponding output when I type "done 1"/"delete 2" command** and click send button. (but it executes the operation, i.e. it marks an item or delete an item at the backfront)
For other commands such as  "todo return book" and "list", it does work well.

The following is the code involving "clear user input" part.
```java
    @FXML
    private void handleUserInput() throws InterruptedException {
        String input = userInput.getText();
        String response = duke.getResponse(input);

Hi, @Agentum07 
Based on those highly-ranked answers under the stackoverflow question, I added Json anotations to constructors ```@JsonCreator``` and ```@JsonProperty``` (also updated the code in my github) but it still doesn't work.
Besides, the original UserPrefs class doesn't involve Json anotations but the system can read and write it through Json file successfully.

Hi Prof @damithc , 

For my team tP, during testing, I realised the application crashes when I run the jar file application in java 14. How we knew this was because, in my terminal, I have 2 Java version 14 and 11 and initially the jar applications were running in the java version 14 and it crashes after a certain point, but not in java 11.

Should we then explicitly mention in our UG or DG, that testers or users wanting to run our application has to ensure that they are running the jar files on a java 11 jar version?? If so, do we need to also share in our UG how users can change their java version to version 11 in their terminals?

This is might be worrisome as users may highlight ours or even other groups application as broken if they can't even open the application in the first place. Only to not realise they are running in java 14 or some other version when running the jar file in their terminal or java launcher.

Hi everyone,

From #363 and if iirc from lecture, GUI Testing is quite a pain to do.
I tried looking up possiblities of having GUI Testing, and 1 which I came across specifically for JavaFX, was TestFX [here](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX).

Not sure if we can use it, any thoughts prof @damithc?

There is also a medium article on how to get started (though the article is a couple years back, some things may have changed) [here](https://medium.com/@mglover/java-fx-testing-with-testfx-c3858b571320).

I understand it might be a little late introducing this, but I thought it might still be possible for any who are keen to try or wondering about it too. 😄

Hi everyone,

Not sure if this is exactly a tip, but just added knowledge that I thought could be interesting to share.

Currently we are doing Unit testing, which requires us to manually create test functions which can take a ton of time and work. Wouldn't it be better to have some toolkit to be able to automatically create test cases for us? 

There are a couple already in development and can be used, here's one which I've used before: 
- [EvoSuite](https://www.evosuite.org/)

There is also a guide on how you can set it up on intelliJ.
https://www.evosuite.org/documentation/intellij-idea-plugin/

or if you prefer to have video guide on understanding what EvoSuite brings, here's a couple of youtube videos on it:
1. [Automatically generate JUnit test cases using EvoSuite tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0K6VGhqbqg&ab_channel=ShabbirAbdul)
2. [Advanced Software Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv4DD9SpVeo&ab_channel=JanikValentin)

Automatic Test Generation from what I understand, isn't yet entirely perfect but can be a good way to alleviate burden on creating test cases.

EvoSuite isn't the only one, there are also a couple out there in the industry as well such as:
- [Randoop](https://randoop.github.io/randoop/)

Randoop also creates automatic test cases but also in Junit Format.

I'm not exactly sure if we are allowed to use automatic test generators for our project in this module. Perhaps Prof @damithc could add in. But nonetheless I hope this can be a helpful toolkit for your future projects.

Hi, not sure if you've noticed yet but that IntelliJ has their own built-in Git Capability. Though nothing wrong using SourceTree and command line.

Hi @huizhuansam, if we think about JSON in itself, the keys and value are in a form of some objects type (for example,String,integer) and an array. Thus, defintely Java does support it, and there are a wide array of third-party libraries we can use. 
you can refer more here: 
https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/json.html

One third-party library I used before was this: 
https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/

Also, to your question about other formats besides JSON, we can actually make use of comma-seperated values (or .CSV), which can easily be converted to excel sheets. Also, instead of comma-seperated values, we can also consider, tabbed-seperated values (using the '\t' to split the values apart). So, JSON isn't the only way.

I hope this helps. 👍🏽

The last EvoSuite has been updated was a year ago, so perhaps it might have issues deadling with the latest IntelliJ software. You could also try using the commandline if you prefer, or take a look at Randoop too.

Hi @jiarong15,

there is plenty of ways to test exceptions in this case besides using assertEquals().

Some ways, we can test exception:

1. You can use assertThrows, for example: 

```
// expecting an Exception to be thrown when initialising Object A

assertThrows(Exception.class, () ->
            { 
                 Object A = new Object();
            });
```

2. Using try, catch and assertTrue:

```
try{
        Object A = new Object();
        boolean caught = false;

        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
             caught = true;
            // true if NullPointerException is caught, otherwise show message
            //assertTrue(caught, "null pointer exception NOT thrown");
            
        } catch (SomeOtherException e1) {
             caught = true;
           // true if SomeOtherException is caught, otherwise show message
            assertTrue(caught, "exception NOT thrown");
        }
```

> Assuming that in my test that I wrote, if I supply the correct inputs in the instantiation, no exceptions will be thrown and hence what should I include in the catch block in my test class?

My view on this would then be to create a method and not use a try catch and use the throws keyword on the method signature. Given that you ensured your inputs are correct.

There are many other assert methods besides `assertEquals()` that can help in your test cases.

I hope this helps.

Hi @hungkhoaitay, 

Check to ensure you have this: 

1. Launcher Class that runs your Duke Class 
2. your Duke class should be the one where `Duke extends Application`
3. In intellIJ -&gt; check your external libraries that JavaFX libraries is installed (Do so by going `Project Settings -&gt; Libraries`)
4. Also check your javaFX libraries are in your module dependencies, like the image below: 
![Screenshot 2021-09-02 at 1 31 08 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22881285/131787366-775ac3b0-5a8d-4b90-b81d-67ce084c330d.png)


A possible issue even if you have resolve the above, is if you have a module-info.java file, removing it worked for me.
Also trying cleaning and building your gradle and afterwards restart your intelliJ. 
Sometimes a restart might resolve some file issues.

Since we are using JavaFx to create some GUI applications. We may need to save some work or clean up some things before the user chooses to exit the application. 

I would prefer to use Platform.exit(), as we can use a 'hook' method to do some cleaning before actually exiting the application like so. The 'hook' to the platform.exit() is the stop() like so:

```java
public class Duke extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) {......}

    @Override
    public void stop() throws Exception {
        super.stop();
        //When platform.exit() is called, stop() will be called
        System.out.println("Application is closed");
    }
}


```

My first question seeing the topic title, what is the purpose of a constructor ? -&gt; which is mainly to initialise instance variables of a class.

Thus, failing to initialise could lead to an exception (though I believe as good practice, it would be odd to have initialisation that would have exceptions been thrown, meaning our logic perhaps may need some reworking). But I believe  the exception in the constructor should be thrown as it should rather be handled in the class that instantiantes that objects that gives rise to such exceptions rather than the constructor catching the exception. 

But, honestly it really depends on the archiecture of programe your building i guess ? Hope this helps.

Hi @Justinhoejj, 

I am using a mac and running both on terminal and clicking, I don't seem to have any issues. If you are able to run on terminal, it would mean the jar file is running as expected. Perhaps, instead of just double clicking, you could try `right click the jar file and open ?` 

Sometimes mac security would block unauthorised apps from working well as intended by double clicking so to work around it you could try right click and open the jar file and allow access in their Security & privacy settings.

you can take a look at the code coverage site [here](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/about-code-coverage)

Extracting the main bit from the site it basically states: 

`hit` indicates that the source code was executed by the test suite.

`partial` indicates that the source code was not fully executed by the test suite; there are remaining branches that were not executed.

`miss` indicates that the source code was not executed by the test suite.

Assuming that in my test that I wrote, if I supply the correct inputs in the instantiation, no exceptions will be thrown and hence what should I include in the catch block in my test class?
However, if I supply 1 erroneous input which will cause either error 1 or error 2, what do I include in the expected outcome in the assertEquals(expected, actual) method in the try block in the test class?

Hi Prof @damithc 

My team added a feature in v1.3b before PE-D. The PR for this feature's functional code was merged to master. However, due to an oversight, we did not merge the PR that updates the UG with instructions on how to use this feature. Hence, it was reported as a feature flaw (missing feature) during PE-D.

What should we do now? Are we allowed to add the feature into the UG at this point (which will look like a new feature although the functional code was merged last week)? Do we have to remove this feature?

The reason I'm aware of for the preference for present tense is to be consistent with Git's automatically generated commit messages e.g. **Merge** branch 'XXX' into 'master'.

I believe pushing to master is fine for small projects with only 1 contributor, which is what the individual project currently is.

Also, it's probably better to learn to walk (push to master) before you learn to run (create branches and pull requests).

My `actual.txt` also does not show the user inputs. In the lecture video, it might be that the program prints out the user's command again which is why it shows up in `actual.txt`.

I think I had this problem, and it was caused by the update to packages. Can you check your `bin/` folder? Mine seemed to have two copies of all the files, one set in `bin/` (the older version) and another set in `bin/duke` (the newer version). `runtest.sh` was using the older set in `bin/`.

From my understanding of commits, I don't really see a problem in committing incomplete/messy code to a branch? I'd just make a separate commit to finish it up or refactor it the next day and then merge to master.

If you have written so much code, to the point where you'd feel annoyed if your computer crashed and you lost that progress, doesn't that make the code "a version worth remembering" after all?

For context, this question arose when discussing #91 

Prof said:
> One benefit [of non-fast forward] is it is easy to see the start and end of the branch visually. Plus, the merge commit shows the total effect of the branch.

I think there are still pros to fast-forward merging, and it might depend on preference / team conventions? Some people might think that merge commits clutter up the history unnecessarily. If your branch only has 1 commit with a small bug fix, fast-forward merging might be cleaner since you'd only have 1 commit in `master`. An extra merge commit would be somewhat redundant here.

Full instructions for configuring checkstyle are [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html#configuring-checkstyle-rules)

> Checkstyle expects configuration files for checkstyle (e.g., files that specify which style rules to follow) to be in **`./config/checkstyle/`** by convention.
> The set of code style rules are put in the **`config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`**. To enable exceptions to code styles, you can add in the comment `//CODESTYLE.OFF: RuleName` at the start of the section and `//CODESTYLE.ON: RuleName` at the end of the section. Alternatively, you can specify which rules to suppress in a config file `config/checkstyle/suppressions.xml`

Rename your file to `checkstyle.xml` and copy the content over from [AB3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle).

`suppressions.xml` is a file you have to create yourself, in the same directory.

Have you tried running the jar file from command line? i.e. `java -jar duke.jar`. Do you still face this problem?

> That is, it neither clears the user input bar nor print the corresponding output when I type "done 1"/"delete 2" command and click send button. (but it executes the operation, i.e. it marks an item or delete an item at the backfront)
For other commands such as "todo return book" and "list", it does work well.

Usually when I face a case of "input not getting cleared and message not getting sent", it's because some exception occurred that prevented the program from proceeding. This exception would be printed in the terminal. This seems likely in your case as well, given that it is specific to the `done` and `delete` commands but not the other commands.

Are you familiar with regex?

There's a couple things going on here:

`\S+`
* `\s` refers to any whitespace character
* `\S` refers to any non-whitespace character (regex convention is to use capital letters to denote "not")
* `+` refers to a sequence of 1 or more characters

So, `\S+` refers to a sequence of **1 or more non-whitespace** characters

`.*`
* `.` refers to any character
* `*` refers to a sequence of 0 or more characters (same as the `*` in UML multiplicity)

So, `.*` refers to any sequence of **0 or more of any character**, aka the remainder of the string basically

`(?&gt;name>...)`
* save whatever was captured in the "..." to be referenced later using the `name`

> The way how I currently did is to use the Pattern again on arg2 to separate out arg3, but I wonder if there is a more elegant way to tweak the Pattern somehow and give all 3 args in 1 shot.

Yes, you should be able to do it in 1 shot. Is `arg2` definitely going to be 1 word? I think you can do something along the lines of `Pattern.compile("(?&gt;arg1>\S+)\s(?&gt;arg2>\S+)(?&gt;arg3>.*)");`

**Pro-tip**: you can use websites like [regex101](https://regex101.com/) to learn and test out regex expressions easily. It even has a Java mode that would help greatly here.

Ok for some reason when I copy and paste the ACTUAL output into the EXPECTED within Intellij it does not tell me that there are no differences found. But if I edit the EXPECTED file externally using another editor, it now correctly tells me that there are no differences found. Not sure why though.

Ok I found the problem. Turns out codecov actually needs to generate a test case report or something like that. After editing the program, I tried to take the easy way out and delete all the test cases because I didn't want to rewrite them now. So I put back the test cases and changed it up a bit such that they still pass and now codecov shows no error.

Hey macOS homies 👋🏻 

I ran into this multiple times when opening my friends' JARs and I'm sure some of you may face it when testing another group's `tP` project. Here's a quick hack – for now and future apps that can't seem to open due to security concerns.

If you double-click the `tP` JAR file from a folder, you're probably going to get this warning:

It properly runs through the process of creating the text file (I can see it being created in my file explorer) but immediately conks out after with the above exception. Have no idea where to look or how to assess the problem.

Hoping for any help before the final deadline tonight 🤕

Hey everyone, 

> I'm using IntelliJ 2021.2 Community Edition on macOS.

I get this exception called the `InvocationTargetException` when I try to run the `Launcher.java` that powers the whole chat app. I am not sure of the source of the error, which is why I can't really attach any code snippets.

Has anyone else gotten this exception before? What are some possible things I can do to troubleshoot the problem? I'm down to provide any other details.

Any help appreciated :D

I spoke to some seniors last sem on this very topic who've interned at some great places. They've all told me to use imperative present tense. It seems to be the convention for a lot of Singapore-based companies and startups. A positive argument is that such commit messages are a lot more cleaner and concise.

Hey @VimuthM, thanks for reaching out!

I managed to resolve the issue 😄  Turns out one of my `switch` blocks was causing the problem – I substituted an `if` block with said `switch` block but made a mistake in my target variable for the `switch` statement. Who would have though 😅 

Appreciate the help, though!

I think the aim of `iP` is to procedurally go from testing via CLI to testing via GUI. I fully test on GUI now as the functionality is exactly the same, just that it has a fancy UI to display the results. At least, it motivates us to intuitively create our GUI such that it fully mimics the experience of using the CLI version of the chatbot. Once we have the GUI, there doesn't seem to be a need to go back to the CLI anymore because the UX and user flow are the exact same.

Am I right in saying that this is the objective of the `Duke iP`? @damithc

## Future Work
- Making the chatbot dialogues more JARVIS-like from the movies
- Adding some sarcastic replies here and there (ie. easter eggs 👀)
- Making the commands more natural (like plain English) – may need a complex parser, though

Hey @VimuthM, thanks for reaching out!

May I know what it looks like if you type in `list` in the chatbot for the version you tried out? I just added a patch that lets the bot create the `duke.txt` file in case it doesn't exist. 

Also, I tried running `duke.jar` that I found in the `build/libs/duke.jar` directory. But I got these errors:

```
Error: Main method not found in class duke.Duke, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application
```

Not sure how to proceed from here either 🤷🏻‍♂️  I'll try something out.

The error message indicates the java is not configured properly in your zsh. You can check this [first](https://superuser.com/questions/1636321/how-to-solve-unable-to-locate-a-java-runtime-that-supports-error) and another way is to test by opening Intellij Terminal and just type java -version or javac -version.

[this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59762143/recovering-dropped-stash-is-not-a-stash-like-commit) might help you besides the documentation that Wayne points out!

on a side note, I don't think git stash store is a command that is used unless you are doing scripting (like creating the stash manually and storing it), usually, to stash a commit, people would use git stash / git stash save / git stash push (or use Intellij VCS or SourceTree to prevent such error)

What FergusMok wrote was actually really nice! but besides the modularity, I think one other disadvantage that you might face with a very huge chunk of the switch statement is the burden on your IDE (IntelliJ in this case I believe), if your file becomes very huge to the point exceeding ~2k lines, when your ide tries to do syntax analysis and indexing of the file, it will take very long.

I think there are some ways, but I'm not really sure about this
1. You can supply your void functions with different inputs and check `assertDoesNotThrow`, meaning it works fine 
2. You can check invalid input and try whether any exception is thrown 
3. You can try to check whether some property changes due to the mutation by void function (or any indicator) 
4. Or check the output in `System.out`

That's my 2 cents

I think you should make the `test` folder as the Gradle test root folder. Gradle then would recognize the path and build it, you can check this [resource](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/testing.html#create-test-resources-root), the result is that the `test` folder should have similar blue box like the `main`

I don't think these lines of code create the dir and the file if they don't exist before. Maybe you can use a Java `File` Object and then use the method `mkdirs` and `createNewFile` to create the file and directory first

One of the constraints mentioned is that the program data should be human editable. Is it OK to have the program data be in an encrypted format, but also give the option for users to import data from a user-editable format? 

I would argue that it does not go against the spirit of the constraint because what would eventually become the program data is still very much user-editable.

I'm pretty sure it is not a good practice to change commit messages, especially after it has been pushed to remote + there are multiple commits on top of the commit you want to edit since you are effectively rewriting history. However, it can be done, and especially easy with a GUI; check out this [article](https://docs.github.com/en/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/changing-a-commit-message).

Let's use the time-traveling analogy:

1. The tip of the branch is the present.
2. Checking out previous commits is like traveling back in time in a time machine.
3. The `.gitignore` file is like a list of stuff you bring along with the time machine that is not affected by the time travel, everything else that is not in the `.gitignore` list will be "reversed" in time. (Please note that the `.gitignore` file is affected by time travel too!)
4. At some point in your time traveling, you will meet two copies (versions) of the same stuff: `file_a` you brought with you in your time travel and `file_a` of the past.
5. If these 2 copies have not been changed between the present and the past, the situation you mentioned will not happen. 
6. However, if between the present and past there were some changes made to `file_a`, git will tell you that "I found 2 versions of the same file", so it will appear as unstaged changes.

This took me a while to understand, and even longer to explain LOL. Hope this helps.

**Edit_2:** added parenthesis in point 2.

> why doesn't git use the .gitignore at Point A and show the temp file at Point A

Git does use the `.gitignore` at Point A. Because the temp file is still being tracked at Point A, git notices the difference and sees it as a change. Conversely, if you check out any commit made after Point B, git does not care.

> given that we are committing the .gitignore file everytime we make a revision?

That is not the case, the `.gitignore` file is committed like any other file in git unless specified.

It might also be IntelliJ not changing your project configuration. See the top right of IntelliJ (the dropdown beside the green hammer), it might be using the build from a different branch or a previous version of your code.

I think the best way to not have any font issues is to package the font together with the application. 

See https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/pull/106 for the changes made to AB3 to fix the font problem. We probably should do something similar for iP.

Another solution is just to use the SceneBuilder to set the font to some common font in all OSes.

You are using the ARM version of java i think. If you previously installed java using brew then you are definitely using ARM java. Try to uninstall java using `brew uninstall` and install the x86 version from [oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

@rohit0718 You have to run java under rosetta 2. Java ARM works fine but dependencies might not be updated yet. I faced this issue when i was running AB3 for the first time. Deleted ARM java and installed Java x86 one and it worked.

Hi Prof @damithc, may I know what exactly is the problem here? I have tested jar files for my friends for iP, one of them using windows and another MacOS catalina (intel system) and I have no problem running them under rosetta.

Edit: I realised that both of them are using custom CSS files to specify fonts that are available in all systems. For those who are facing this problem, you can follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwV_L3lKYYw) to uninstall java first before installing the version mentioned by prof @damithc  above. I tested a jar file that does not set the font, it seems to work.

> @sivayogasubramanian What is rosetta? I am on an intel chip Mac, but the person I am reviewing has font issues. Would like to try to use rosetta to fix the font issue, as it seems that the java version mentioned above is not applicable to me

Rosetta 2 enables a Mac with Apple silicon (M1 chip) to use apps built for a Mac with an Intel processor. You should not need rosetta. You can try downloading the above JDK. But remember to change the architecture to x86 64 bit.

I'm not sure how to represent a specific enum type in Sequence Diagrams, as I want to call a method from the enum type (and not a static method from the enum class itself). 

Lets say I have an enum called `ValidFilterInterviewArgs`, which contains the types PAST and FUTURE.
How to I represent ValidFilterInterviewArgs.PAST?

These are a few ones I was deciding between:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77266823/140336336-ebef309d-fc2a-4504-b48f-a6d529318fa8.png)

Or should I just omit the type completely and do this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77266823/140336778-a2f29895-3d28-4f19-9afd-9d5f3a83275a.png)

For example, this diagram is much bigger and clearer:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77266823/140293964-eb51524c-4431-42af-81cc-d47ecc9c2f69.png)


While this diagram is very small and blurry:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77266823/140293894-51477774-6819-40fe-adc5-c2adfa7706bb.png)

Currently I'm just leaving it as a private enum nested in the class that is using it.
</panel>

<panel  header="**4. :fas-info-circle: My welcome message is truncated**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/252" expanded>

For some reason, only my welcome message is truncated. Additionally, only the last line is truncated. If it has 2 lines, the 2nd line will become an ellipsis. If it has 8 lines, the 8th line will be truncated to become an ellipsis. However, if it only has 1 line, it works fine so technically, as a hacky solution (and potentially a last resort), I could just make my greeting 1 line. 

I've found that removing `wrapText="true"` fixes this, but causes every other dialog box to be  truncated (because as a result of removing `wrapText="true` it doesn't wrap).

This is how it looks like now (Ignore the messed up logo, its due to a recent change in font):
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77266823/133774018-e3e95fab-0d67-4b29-9486-d5dda41358e7.png)

Another odd thing is how this problem came about. Originally, my program worked fine (on Windows OS), and nothing was truncated. However, when I sent my friend (MacOS) for testing, all my dialog boxes were truncated. So I went to fix it by editing the `.fxml` files. As a result, this problem arose. However, if I remove my changes, the problem does not seem to go away.

Below are my `fxml` files for reference:

`DialogBox.fxml`:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77266823/133774839-0abced9b-fbb9-4e07-ad76-517f89698bb3.png)

Lastly, I found this issue on a CS2103 forum dated 2 years ago that mentions changing from `Label` to `Text` might fix this, but I tried and I got some other issue like unsupported operand or something. Plus doing so might result me in having to change other settings such as padding, etc, so I rather not. If it can't be solved, I think I will just change my greeting to 1 line, but I was just wondering why it's so weird.

Previously my UI class involved methods that printed the logo, single and double divider lines,  and obtaining user input using `Scanner`. Since the addition of the GUI, we no longer need UI elements like divider lines, and no longer need to obtain user input using `Scanner`. Thus I deleted the UI class altogether. But do I technically now fall short of the minimal requirements for week 3's `A-MoreOOP`? It mentioned that one of the minimal requirements was to have a UI class, or does it just mean at that point of time (when u check the tag), the commit should have the UI class.

I'm trying to separate the classes further into sub-packages, but some classes from one sub-package uses instances of classes (sometimes many) from another sub-package.

1) Am I supposed to import them from 1 sub-package to another? Feels kind of weird.

2) Usually the convention is to not use * in imports. For example, we shouldn't use `java.util.*`, but how about importing other sub-packages? For example can I use `import duke.task.*;` , especially when I want to use all of the classes in that sub-package.

3) How should I order these imports? For example should the imports from other sub-packages within the same package come before the other imports like from `java.util`? And should they be separated by a blank line? I could not find these in the CS2103T website conventions.

I feel there's simply no need to write whenever the list changes, since the file is only used when Duke is starting up. This might also help keep Duke interactions snappy and quick.

@damithc Thanks for the help, I have found a solution to the issue after looking for difference between my project and others.
It seems that the path to the tests need to be exactly `/src/test/java/test.java`.
Like this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70138507/131327438-98c98899-a5c3-43bb-8ba8-958632bb0bdd.png)

Should a static method even be overridden? Static means the method can be called without an instance, and with no object instance theres no dynamic binding or calling of overridden methods taking place

> * Let's say the UG specifies the app does duplicate detection and the detection is case insensitive. Then, the feature is designed well enough. But if the actual behavior is case sensitive, it is a bug in the implementation, which you are allowed to fix it in v1.4
> * Alternatively, if the UG doesn't mention anything about the case sensitivity (or even if it states that it is case sensitive) and the duplicate detection is actually case sensitive, there is a flaw in the way the feature is designed, which is not allowed to be fixed in v1.4

This makes me worried about teams gaming the system. What's stopping them from simply updating the UG? Feels like such a grey area.

Hi all. I know this is quite late, but does this method also fix font issues when the program is run from IntelliJ?

If I open a .jar file, there is no font issues. However, I still encounter the font issues from IntelliJ.

I have followed all the necessary steps, including downloading the correct OpenJDK version (11.0.12+7, JDK FX, I tried both ARM 64-bit and x86 64-bit), setting the `JAVA_HOME` and `JDK_HOME` paths. When I write `whereis java` and `which java`. It also gives me the correct output. Thank you. Really appreciate the help!

try to google how the git push command works. Level-7 is not the remote you're pushing to, it's the tag name. git push takes in the remote as the first parameter, so in this case it was trying to push to the remote 'Level-7', which doesn't exist

In general do not use `==` for non primitive types, since java treats instances of classes as different objects for that. Where possible, opt for the `equals()` method.

I think you probably have Java 8 still installed on your system, and this Windows might be defaulting to that for its pathing. Try uninstalling and checking your windows path variables to see if it's now correctly pointed to JDK 11 for the Java variable. You can see how to change path variables [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html). I had the same issue sometimes when I got friends to test my bot and uninstalling or changing path variables fixed it.

It could be due to trailing spaces being removed by IntelliJ automatically. (If you select the text above you'll see the second line has spaces after the last underscore but the first doesn't.)

I originally put the spaces in for _`expected.txt`_ and only realised later that IntelliJ was trimming all trailing white spaces every time I saved the file. Unfortunately `diff` (in Mac at least) does not support ignoring trailing white spaces so I went to IntelliJ and disabled their function.

I'm just guessing here, how `System` actually works is beyond me, so please take this with a grain of salt:

`System.in` is a stream, and for every `Scanner` object you create it will take in `System.in` and try to read the next few bytes of the user input. Problem is, Java streams are meant to be consumed and cannot be reused. If you use up a position on a stream, you can't reread it, and the only way forward is to take up the next step in the stream.

Maybe if multiple Scanners try to read the same `System.in`, only the first one manages to move the position to the next point in the stream, and the rest are in an unreadable position?

If you are the type to do a lot of commits to 'checkpoint', I recommend checking out `git rebase -i` to quickly squash, reorder and amend commit messages to clean up the mess. If you don't specify any other arguments to `git rebase -i`, it will default to letting you work on all the commits on your current branch right up to the last push.

Btw, its not a good practice to force push (in case someone is checking out your branch), so please avoid amending any commit that you've already pushed.

Hey I had this question too and I was looking around and found [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46060236/4179939) that explains the difference between the two.

The tldr of it is that `Platform.exit()` calls for JFX to close up shop and exit gracefully, running clean up code if provided. Since your original java file likely only has a single line calling for `Application.launch()` there's nothing left for the Java virtual machine to do and it exits.

On the other hand `System.exit()` demands the Java virtual machine to terminate and doesn't allow for any further execution of JFX or any other code.

Looks to me the better practice would be to run `Platform.exit()` but in our case if no clean up code is required it won't cause too much harm to do the other one.

Sorry, this wouldn't really help your current situation, but just FYI: package names are supposed to be all in lowercase, so it should be the package `duke` not `Duke`. (So the package name is `duke.Duke`, not `Duke.Duke`). Remember to change the folder name too!

Btw your Github action currently calls for the task to be run on Windows, Linux and Mac platforms, and you have to wait for all the tasks to be repeated thrice. If you are just running `gradlew check` for checkstyle and you aren't testing anything that could be platform dependent, you can do just run the action on just linux and save your time.

Not sure if this would fit your use case, but we chose to add an additional field to `CommandResult` that contains the necessary method calls and passing the required parameters (in your case, a string or list etc). Its a fairly clean way to cover any possible side effect on Ui that we want to happen on execution. Here's an example of how it could look like:

```java
public class CommandResult {
  private final Consumer<Ui> uiAction;
  CommandResult(String feedbackToUser, Consumer<Ui> uiAction) { /*...*/ }
}
```

So if you need to pass a string to a particular method `changeTitle` in `Ui`:
```java
public class ChangeTitleCommand {
  public CommandResult execute() {
    // ...
    String newTitle = "jsfsdfsd";
    return new CommandResult(feedback, ui -&gt; ui.changeTitle(newTitle));
  }
```

So if you need to pass a List<Integer> to a particular method `takeNewNums` in `Ui`:
```java
public class ChangeTitleCommand {
  public CommandResult execute() {
    // ...
    List<Integer> nums = List.of(1,2,3);
    return new CommandResult(feedback, ui -&gt; ui.takeNewNums(nums));
  }
```

Then when you actually execute the `CommandResult`, just remember to run the `uiAction.accept(ui)` to perform the logic.

> Launch the jar file using the java -jar command rather than double-clicking (reason: to ensure the jar file is using the same java version that you verified above). Use double-clicking as a last resort.

To be safe, we probably shouldn't do this, even if the authorised dev issue is solved.

Hey @willyamped I think what's happening there is that IntelliJ is calling up the wrong java version. You should check Project SDK under Project Structure with your tp folder opened in IntelliJ.

so i think i have solved the issue. i think it really could be because of the accidental deletion of my remote coding standard branch. my i solved it by first resetting to one of my early coding standard commits and then recommitting and reversing that commit (very confusing stuff)... but bottom line is, dont delete your remote branches (at least in the context of this mod)

Here is my code for displaying all tasks when the command `list` is given.

In Duke.java
```java
public String getResponse(String input) {
    //...
    if (parser.isDisplay(input)) {
        return taskList.displayAllTasks();
    }
    //...

In TaskList.java
```java
public String displayAllTasks() {
    String allTasks = "Here are the tasks in your list: \n";
    for (int i = 0; i < inputs.size(); i++) {
        int index = i + 1;
        allTasks += index + ". " + inputs.get(i).toString() + "\n";

I actually encountered this in previous versions (still using CLI instead of GUI). I double-clicked the jar file and it shows this. I can only use `java -jar duke.jar` to open it.
It is no longer an issue after I changed to GUI and used Gradle to regenerate a fat jar file.

So you have two lists of Persons, one is the regular one, one is for those with birthday reminders. When you add/edit a Person in the regular list, the Person in the birthday reminder list should also change, but it does not. Am I correct? 
You may want to find out whether the problem is with the UI or the logic. When you add/edit a Person, does it change in the birthday list, just that it's not shown in UI? Or is it not added/updated at all, which means the logic is missing?

Hi @tianyue58. I believe you can insert this line `--------|----------` (or sth in this format, doesn't have to match exactly) between the header of the table and the content. Then when the table falls on a page break, the header will automatically appear again on the second page as well, so that in a way the table is still presentable.
Of course you can also use the code for page break to adjust the pages so that your table falls nicely on one single page.
Hope this can help.

## Library

[MDFX](https://github.com/JPro-one/markdown-javafx-renderer)
[TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX)

## Purpose

Use for parsing Markdown File into a JavaFX view.
Use for GUI testing of the view

## License

[Apache](https://github.com/JPro-one/markdown-javafx-renderer/blob/master/LICENSE)
[EUPL](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

## Rationale

Hi Prof, I deeply apologize for this late request and for my carelessness, due to myself not knowing that I have to request for permission before using any library. I initially thought that it is sufficient to acknowledge usage of third party library as a form of reusing code (which is detailed on week 12 website), but I have never known that I need to request a permission to use it until recently when I asked my tutor about using TestFX, reminding me that I have used another third party library before but haven't submitted any request.

May I ask you to grant a permission? What do I need to do at the moment considering that the feature I implemented using the library is on v1.2 rather than at the moment?

Hi guys, I have a question with regards to what is considered good programming practice in this case.

Basically, I wanted to carry additional information (other than feedback to users) in the CommandResult class, and this additional information can be of any types, might be another String, might be a list,.. Because of that, the class will have another field that stores an Optional object to wrap the additional information mentioned above.

Because of that, I wanted to use Optional&gt;? extends Object> to wrap the information. However, is it considered acceptable, considering that I'm not using raw type and using &gt;? extends Object> is too generalized, and that might not be a good design pattern (considering that anyone can pass null in)? What are the upsides and downsides of using Optional&gt;? extends Object> as a local final field and as parameter in CommandResult?

Hi everyone, I have a question with regards to field type,

Basically, is it a must that all fields in a class are final fields? Or can non-final fields be acceptable?

Specifically, I'm referring to a modification of the class CommandResult like this. To add some context, I'm consider modifying the class in order to take in an additional help message field if the CommandResult object is a help message. I do not consider modifying the existing number of arguments as it would require the redefinition of the entire codebase, but rather the field is only needed when the CommandResult is indeed a help.

```
private final String feedbackToUser;

/** Help information should be shown to the user. */
private final boolean showHelp;

/** The application should exit. */
private final boolean exit;

private String helpContent = "None";

Hi guys, I would like to ask a question on saving task list modification in Duke, specifically on efficiency and runtime.

Is runtime important? In trying to save changes in the list of task, I decided to rewrite the file all over again, as in, iterate through the task List and manually rewrite the file from begin to end.

Is this an acceptable approach to Level-7?
Or do I have to trace which task has changed, then search through .txt file for the task that matches and modify only that specific line? Would that be possible?

The CommandBox object is constructed in MainWindow I believe, which takes in the CommandExecutor (which in this case is the method execute() of type CommandResult) from the MainWindow. 
When you call in the method handleCommandEntered(), it executes the command not through CommandBox but through MainWindow instead - so the GUI updating is not done through CommandBox, it is rather done in MainWindow through the resultDisplay.setFeedbackToUser(text).

> But isn't this only updating the command result? I think it doesn't update the person list panel. when I delete `resultDisplay.setFeedbackToUser(text)` , and try find command, the person list can still be updated

That's because resultDisplay is setting the result, and not updating the list - it's done at the model when logic is executing the command.

As for person list update and changing, you can try modifying the two classes StudentCard and StudentListPanel to see the changes on them - model is interacting with these two classes directly.

I hope this helps.

I'm following the [suggested .yml file](https://github.com/se-edu/duke/blob/full-template/.github/workflows/gradle.yml) for a sample GitHub Actions workflow, and I have a few questions about the `steps` of the job:

- Why do we need 2 "Set up repository" steps at the start? And why does the second `checkout` action insists on `ref: master`, what happens if I'm pushing from a non-master branch?
- Third step, why is it called "Merge to master"? I thought the `git checkout` command here means switching to the commit that triggered the workflow...
- I know we can remove the last 3 segments for I/O redirection tests, but I would like to ask why do we need `always()` for the last two steps? I'm referring to the part `if: always() && runner.os == 'macOS'`
- Finally, many actions seem to use an older version, like `actions/checkout@master`. I see the GitHub tutorials use `actions/checkout@v2`, is there a reason for this?

Through the iP I can understand how to branch and merge with git, but how does this work for a real team project? I can think of a scenario like this:

Suppose 2 people A and B each work on a separate feature. They create their own branch, `branch-A` and `branch-B`, branching out from the same commit on `master`. Person A, who has finished working on the feature, creates a PR which is approved and merged into `master`. Meanwhile person B is still working in `branch-B`.

- Should B pull from remote to check for updates in `master`? Or just concentrate and finish their work?
- If B should pull, what if B only wants to pick _some_ changes from the updated `master`, not everything?

Initially, class `Duke` only contains the `main` method. Now I want to have some instance attributes in `Duke`, so I can instantiate it inside `main()` like this:

```java
public class Duke {
  private String someAttribute;

  private Duke(String s) {
    someAttribute = s;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // print logo
    Duke d = new Duke("Hello");
    // do other things...
  }
}
```
Is this considered bad practice? I think it might be OK as long as I set the attributes and constructor as `private`, but I've read elsewhere that the class containing `main` -- in this case, class `Duke` -- should only serve as the entry point of the programme and have no other methods or attributes.

I think you can try merging the branch `add-gradle-support` to add the Gradle files instead of adding them by yourself (that's how I did it following the [SE-EDU tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html) given on the cs2103 web page).

My inexperienced opinion is that work-in-progress commits are okay, especially when you're working on a branch. There is a [`squash`](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/git-squash/) command in Git that combines multiple commits into one, which should be useful when you want to tidy up the commit log after finishing your work.

@weichang18 I'm having the same error as well, and my DialogBox is exactly the same from the tutorial. Throws a `java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException` whenever I hit enter in the text input or click Send, but based on the stack trace I think the actual cause is due to a `NullPointerException` somewhere. Pls post the solution if you find one 🙏

Update: Turns out the problem is in my Duke class. The app goes from Launcher -&gt; Main -&gt; MainWindow -&gt; Duke, but my Duke was not properly initialised (due to copying my original code) so it causes a null pointer exception.

@SkyBlaise99 To my understanding when GitHub Actions run `./gradlew check`, that command already runs the JUnit tests. That's because the Gradle `check` task depends on the `test` task, which are your unit tests executed with JUnit.

uh I think it runs JUnit tests only, that's why they put 3 segments at the end for the I/O redirection tests. But since our iP is moving to a GUI now, those tests are no longer relevant and can be removed from the script.

Thanks for this, it helped me find my JDK. Mine happened to be in /Users/xxxx/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines and not /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines. Spent quite a while looking for it.

Hi guys, I followed the steps and am currently on the correct version of JDK. However, when I run the code to run the duke.jar file to evaluate the person assigned to me, the font issue is still not fixed. What do I do?

I am currently on the mac intel so I downloaded the x86 64 version.

Yes i did `export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11.jdk/Contents/Home` and `export JDK_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11.jdk/Contents/Home` already but still the fonts are not fixed.

Sorry for the inconvenience caused by screenshotting it instead of copying it over, it slipped my mind. Will copy and paste it next time.

I think this is it. I went to download the JDK FX version again and it is working now. I must have accidentally downloaded the JDK one earlier....twice.... Thank you for helping me catch this @kouyk ! If not I would not have solved it so quickly.

On searching the internet, I found a solution to use `Font` like:
```Java
        Font defaultFont = new Font("Arial", 15);
        Label helloWorld = new Label("Hello World!");
        helloWorld.setFont(defaultFont);
        Scene scene = new Scene(helloWorld);
        stage.setScene(scene);
        stage.show();
```
and this works fine.
output:

> Task :compileJava

I have a workaround, but is there any possible way to fix this and avoid using `Font`, which works just fine?

Hi Guys, our team is in a Team meeting facing an issue for choosing a direction in whether Evolve or Morph.

After we go through the grading script, I still have 2 questions, 
https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/admin/tp-grading.html

1. If I add more features without bugs in Morph, then will I get more marks, compared to normal features without bugs in Evolve？

2. Will we can get more marks in a good design GUI, "smarter CLI"?

3. If we just solve all the bugs in AB3, fit the main features to the topic like (CLI, User-friendly GUI) in "Context management - Evolve",  without adding any extra features, what kind of result or mark we will get?

Thanks a lot

May I please ask what is relationship between software under test (SUT), Unit testing, Regression Testing, Test Automation, Test Driver, Stub (There are the contents under testing topic)?

This is my understanding below:

The developer 
1. need to perform testing (Developer Testing) for the software (SUT). 
2. can use JUnit to make testing automation. (When using the Junit framework, does it mean that dont need to implement the test driver class?)
3. need to implement unit testing for each function, and need to implement Stub for the tested function to isolate dependencies if the logic in the function depends on other functions.
4. need to run all the test cases (Regression Testing) again after bug fixed.

And I dont quite understand the question 29: "A stub is an alternative implementation of an SUT; by having two alternative implementations, we reduce the risk of bugs."

I think the first part of the sentence "A stub is an alternative implementation of an SUT" is correct right? Then what is the meaning of "by having two alternative implementations"?

I share some my own opinion:
1. I think the developer should keep pulling the latest version of the code from mater.
2. Need one developer to manage the master, means he is the leader to press the "Agree to merge" button. Before merging the PR, all the developers should sit together to do a code review for the PR to make sure the PR is bug free and all of them agree with the change of PR.
3. Then I don't think your second point will happen if following the 2 steps above.

In this case, the most relevant aspect is 'effort', and the evaluation is done by peers/tutors, based on code, documentation, and actual use of the feature. And as mentioned before, you get full marks for effort as long as you exceed a certain bar. Any value-adding effort is counted, irrespective of morph or evolve.

But you can lose marks if the product doesn't fit the target user, who is expected to prefer CLI.

> Finally, the reason we nudge you towards evolve is because evolving doesn't require you to do a major overhaul at the very beginning (when you are still not familiar with the code base) and evolving helps you learn more from the same effort (because you'll be pushing existing features further rather than re-implementing basic features). In terms of grading, there is no difference between the two options.

Dear prof @damithc 

I really appreciate your detail explanation.

Actually I only know that the effort is evaluated by peers who tested your product and tutors, I didn't see more information about it.
Regarding the sentence "If the implementation effort required to create AB3 from scratch is 10", may I please ask if there is any specific standard or baseline for "created AB3" (means how many functions do we need to complete to get 10)?
Some one think that completing 10 functions will get 10, but some others think that completing 1 function will get 10, although both projects are bug free.

I think should not remove the text-ui-test path in the yml because it will run the all test cases in it during the CI. If all these files are ignored, then it just run nothing and pass all the test cases.

I think the reason is the GUI cannot be executed during the CI, you should exclude your GUI Main.class and Launcher.class and other GUI related files in runtest.bat or runtest.sh to make sure your text-ui-test can run properly before push to CI.

I ran duke.jar on mac os in 2 ways

1.  By double clicking on duke.jar in desktop. After entering a few commands my duke data persists but **I am unable to locate the folder which it reads/writes from**. Even when Duke.jar Relocated to a different folder, the data persists. 

2. By `java -jar duke.jar` from command line behaviour is as expected, a data directory is created and duke data written in txt.

> So you have two lists of Persons, one is the regular one, one is for those with birthday reminders. When you add/edit a Person in the regular list, the Person in the birthday reminder list should also change, but it does not. Am I correct? 

Yes your understanding of the problem are correct, I have tested that both of them share the same person by using a == comparator to compare memory addresses. Unless the address book creates a new person completely when it edits?

> You may want to find out whether the problem is with the UI or the logic. When you add/edit a Person, does it change in the birthday list, just that it's not shown in UI? Or is it not added/updated at all, which means the logic is missing?

The problem is likely with the logic for "listening". When reading the developer guide it says that the UI listens to the model. But I cannot identify the code that support this mechanism of UI listening to the model. Hence the question of how does the UI respond to changes in the model?

I encountered an issue where my `ACTUAL.TXT` and `EXPECTED.TXT` differ by a few trailing spaces (in the logo area).

Hence, I manually add the missing trailing spaces to `EXPECTED .TXT` in **Intellij**. The newly added trailing spaces are there after I saved the file. However, they always disappear after I run `runtest.bat`.

I tried copy over the content from `ACTUAL.TXT` to `EXPECTED.TXT` using `Ctrl + a`, `Ctrl + c` and `Ctrl + v`, but those spaces were somehow not copied over, i.e. the difference between the files remains the same.

To solve this, I changed `line 18` of `runtest.bat` from
`java -classpath ..\bin Blue &gt; input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT`
to 
`java -classpath ..\bin Blue &gt; input.txt > EXPECTED.TXT`
so that the outputs were printed to `EXPECTED.TXT` directly.

This will result in the following error in console:
`FC: cannot open ACTUAL.TXT - No such file or folder`
but it will disappear in the next run after we change `line 18` of `runtest.bat` back to its original form.

Note that I couldn't replicate the issue after getting the correct content into my `EXPECTED.TXT`. 
I am not sure how the issue happened, but I hope this tip can help those who face a similar situation.

The class symbol is correct, and it has the correct file extension in Explorer. 

However, it cannot resolve the class when referenced in `MainWindow.fxml`, as indicated by the red text.

This suggests that the red text

might be due to failing to resolve them.

Note that when I type `blue.` the autocomplete options included `MainWindow`, which after selected, shows in red.
On the other hand, a `MainWind` class that I created again to test, shows in the autocomplete options too. And when selected, it shows normally in `MainWindow.fxml`, but the file title `MainWind` is shown red in the side bar.

This seems like a syncing issue between files. So, I tried _Invalidate caches_ again, but the problem remains (after finish indexing).

Hi @Jh123x thanks for the reply. I have marked the ```java``` folder under ```[project root]/src/test/java``` as the test source rather than the ```test``` folder, as per the steps of the guide provided to our batch. 

I understand that you are cloning my repo and trying it out on your local env. Thanks for the help, I really appreciate it! I have yet to push anything regarding Junit testing to my master branch. But to summarize the steps I took, from my latest github commit, I basically followed the steps of the guide [https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/junit.html](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/junit.html), right until step 7.2.

According to the Intellij Hints, I am adding Junit 5.7.0.

@Jh123x replacing the section of ip.iml that you highlighted did not work for me. However, you mentioned that you were developing on windows 10 natively while I was using WSL. I cloned the repo onto the native windows env and worked on that repo instead, which solved the issue for me.

> For the last part, I realize that the warning "missing return statement" is actually not due to the missing of return statement in catch block, but rather, it's that in the try block, I have an isolate if block which does nothing but throws an exception. That's the real cause of the error message. But I still don't know what to do in this case. My logic for that particular scenario is that when the if condition is met then the method should just throw an exception; it just doesn't make any sense to return anything afterwards... So what should I do?

As per this [SO thread](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33536321), all logical paths must result in a valid exit of the method, i.e. for all possible cases, either something is returned or an exception is thrown as per the method signature. 

So it might not be the case that Intellij expects you to return something in your if-block, but rather, that for a particular path of logic in your method, nothing is returned or thrown. 

**Maybe** Intellij's linter isn't smart enough to definitively pinpoint where the leakage is, which is why it is wrongly flagging it in your if-block. (Don't quote me on this though)

Edit: Is the problem that you are facing a compilation error, or a hint by Intellij's linter? If it is the former, then it is definitively the case that for some case(s), nothing is returned or thrown.

In this version I removed the final 'else' part so that if both if conditions aren't met then the method is **guaranteed to return something**, which should be ok...?

There are a few scenarios where your method does not return anything. 

Suppose the first if-statement in your try-block throws the InvalidInputException, then the subsequent lines of code in the try-block will not be executed. Instead, your method will catch the InvalidInputException in your catch-block and execute the sout statement. Once that is done, your method no longer has anything else to execute, but has to exit without returning anything, which is not a valid behaviour since it is expecting a String to be returned.

Hopefully this makes things clearer!

This method LGTM in terms of covering all logical paths, but if it is necessary for you catch the exception within the method itself, it could be good to draw out a tree of the possible cases you expect, and use that as a reference when crafting your method. 

Otherwise, it could be good to think about whether it is really necessary for you to catch the exception there and then. 
(I personally prefer deferring the act of catching the exception until it is absolutely necessary to do so, since the method can always bubble the problem upwards until a point where someone else has to catch it eventually. However, if it is not necessary for the method to catch and resolve it but is caught and resolved by the method anyways, it might lead to some other problems down the line, where we need the exception as part of the logic flow of another method, but we are unable to "uncatch" the exception that was already caught, if that makes sense to you)

> Somehow I still feel like we should keep the "influence scope" of an exception as small as possible so that we won't need to worry about it elsewhere? Why does it make sense to "defer the act of catching the exception until it is absolutely necessary to do so"?

An example I can think of is this:
Imagine if the person who wrote Java's ```ArrayList::get``` method handled the ```IndexOutOfBoundsException``` within the method itself, rather than throwing it. (Maybe instead of throwing the exception, the method prints "The index that was specified is out of bounds", and then returns null)

We, the users of ```ArrayList::get```, would probably prefer it more if the person did not design the method in such a way. In most cases, we would probably prefer the method to throw the exception, so that we can decide on the most meaningful way to deal with it instead.

Of course, this is just my opinion on this, and I'm sure there are many counter-examples that can justify why we should keep the "influence scope" of exceptions as small as possible. Ultimately, the complex nature of code design makes it a nuanced subject, so I think the most important thing is that the way you design your code should make logical sense to you; if writing your code in a certain way doesn't feel right to you, then it probably isn't. (With that being said, we will still have to adhere to the design conventions stipulated by the module, or any other rules established in any other projects. But, apart from those set of rules, I believe we are free to exercise our own judgement call)

There are a quite a few bug reports about various aspects of our application (TutorAid - aimed at private tutors for tracking contacts, lessons and progress) and my team is concerned if we can do the following:

### Simplifying a feature
**Current implementation:** Add / remove a link between any number of students and any number of lessons
**Proposed implementation:** Add / remove a link between one student and one lesson
The rationale here is that the original feature seems rather buggy and most private tutors do not need to frequently add or remove students from lessons

### Add sanity checks for fields
**Current implementation:** Lesson timing can be any string
**Proposed implementation:** Lesson timing has to be of the format HH:MM - HH:MM, (dayOfWeek). Is this allowed? It was identified as a feature flaw by several testers as users can enter irrelevant things into the Timing field.

### Remove feature and edit scope
Our payment tracking system is very limited in functionality (doesn't reset at the end of the month). This is an oversight in our development process and it's too late to add this functionality now. Our program may not satisfy the value proposition identified (as payment tracking was one of the points identified). Are we allowed to remove this feature and exclude payment tracking from the scope?

My team saw this in the module website for this week - does this mean that our Developer Guide must consist all the features planned for v1.2 and v1.3? Or is it just that we must remember to update the use cases and user stories along the way as we add more features?

I have gotten a few comments pointing out that my method below is not named as a verb:

```java
public static String outOfBoundsString(int index) {
    return String.format("Out of bounds: %d", index);
}
```
One suggestion I've been given is to name it `printOutOfBoundsString`, however I feel that this might give the impression that the method might look something like this:

```java
public static void printOutOfBoundsString(int index) {
    System.out.println(
            String.format("Out of bounds: %d", index));
}
```
Furthermore, I think the original name makes more sense when I do something like `System.out.print(outOfBoundsString(index))` as opposed to `System.out.print(printOutOfBoundsString(index))`.

Is there a better way of naming this method / any method that returns a string but doesn't print it?

I've tried setting the Max Height of the dialog box to 'Use Computed Size' but that didn't do it, as the height was still constrained by the main window itself.

If I'm understanding the website instructions correctly, I think importantly is that the commit that signifies the completion of each level should be tagged, e.g. Level-1, Level-2 etc. I believe these can be done even after commits have been pushed. As for changing the commit message of pushed commits, I think this is more complicated and I have no idea how it might be done.

I had the same problem with the substring, what I did was to declare a constant for my operation name and then do `str.substring(operationString.length() + 1)`. My rationale is that this magic number depends on the name of the operation.

I think it is a magic literal though. If someone else looks at it, can they tell why `substring(4)` and not 5 or some other number? I think if they can then it's fine to use it but in this case, someone who doesn't have any context might not understand the number which makes it 'magic'.

Yea so I think I got your point correctly. However, let's confirm this: Having feature flaws in PE will affect grades. We are reported the feature flaw in PED. We are not allowed to change the feature in v1.4. → We are waiting for marks to be deducted although there is one more milestone.
→ We need to do something. → We'd better think of a way to argue that being case sensitive is the correct way.
(Having all of the above even though this is an inherited behavior (not a bug) from AB3. What I really want to say may be that if this **design** of AB3 can affect PE grading, it should be explicitly pointed out earlier, e.g. when tp starts, not after PED.)

I've already tried deleting the tag locally and re-tagging it, and then trying to push it to the remote again, only to get back the same error.

I think I may have misnamed one of my branches yesterday (I called it Level-8 instead of branch-Level-8). I changed it on the remote but I did not change it locally.

This may not be very useful, but what I do is the method recommended in IP. I would first change the code, then run the test and ensure all the parts I expect to fail is the ones that fails. This saves me quite a bit of time as compared to re-writing and thinking of all the changes first. Then, add the new test-cases as needed.

According to the forking workflow, after my pull request has been reviewed and approved by my teammate and get merged to the team's master branch, I need to pull the changes to my local repo, then push to my remote fork. This is illustrated in the image below:

However, I was wondering if this alternative workflow would also work:
1. After my PR get merged, instead of pulling to my local repo, I used the "``fetch upstream``" feature in GitHub, so my remote fork becomes in sync with the upstream team repo.
2. Then I pull the changes from my remote fork to my local repo, so my local repo would also be in sync with the latest changes.

I don't think there's a difference between the two workflows. I wonder why the first is recommend while the second is not mentioned.

<panel  header="**4. :fas-info-circle: Exception handling -- When to use try & catch block and when to add exception to method signature**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/96" expanded>

Hi classmates and profs, I have some questions about exception handling:

We know when there is an exception in a method, we can either: 
-throw that object so that another piece of code can catch it and deal with it, or
-use a try-catch block to deal with the exception within the method body.

In our iP there are indeed a lot of cases in which we need to handle exceptions, but I'm not sure when to use which method. Is there a general suggestion for **when to use which kind of method for exception handling**? Somehow I feel like we should use try-catch as much as possible, since in this case the exception would be handled immediately and thus we don't need to worry about having to deal with exceptions elsewhere? 

Moreover, when I try to use try-catch block within **a method that returns something** (i.e., the method return type is not void), in this case if my catch block only throws an exception without returning anything, Intellij will give me an error message saying I'm **"missing return statement"**. But sometimes it just doesn't make sense to return anything in the catch block, then what else can I do?
</panel>

<panel  header="**5 :fas-comment:**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/96#issuecomment-905452477" expanded>

For the last part, I realize that the warning "missing return statement" is actually not due to the missing of return statement in catch block, but rather, it's that in the try block, I have an isolate if block which does nothing but throws an exception. That's the real cause of the error message. But I still don't know what to do in this case. My logic for that particular scenario is that when the if condition is met then the method should just throw an exception; it just doesn't make any sense to return anything afterwards... So what should I do? 
</panel>

<panel  header="**6 :fas-comment:**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/96#issuecomment-905592069" expanded>

Thanks for the answers! Below is the code I'm working with. Now I realize it's because if none of the if/else block is met then the method indeed returns nothing, which is invalid. 

```   
public String getKeyword()  {
        try {
            if (this.cmdString.length() < 6) throw new InvalidInputException();
            if (this.cmdString.substring(5).trim().length() == 0) throw new InvalidInputException();
            else return this.cmdString.substring(5).trim();
        } catch (InvalidInputException e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
```

If I insist in this logic, then I have to remove the try/catch block and instead add exception to method signature like this:

```
public String getKeyword() throws InvalidInputException {
        if (this.cmdString.length() < 6) throw new InvalidInputException();
        if (this.cmdString.substring(5).trim().length() == 0) throw new InvalidInputException();
        else return this.cmdString.substring(5).trim();
    }
```

However, I'm still not sure why the implementation below doesn't work. In this version I removed the final 'else' part so that if both if conditions aren't met then the method is **guaranteed to return something**, which should be ok...? (but intellij is still giving me the error of missing return statement)

``` 
public String getKeyword() {
        try {
            if (this.cmdString.length() < 6) throw new InvalidInputException();
            if (this.cmdString.substring(5).trim().length() == 0) throw new InvalidInputException();
            **return this.cmdString.substring(5).trim();**
        } catch (InvalidInputException e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
```

Thanks for this detailed explanation! 
But TBH I'm still not quite sure about when to catch an exception. Somehow I still feel like we should keep the "influence scope" of an exception as small as possible so that we won't need to worry about it elsewhere? Why does it make sense to  "defer the act of catching the exception until it is absolutely necessary to do so"?

When our group decided to split AB3 features, I chose some random feature. It was quite minor, basically adding one extra attribute to `Person`. I didn't even make a new command for it, just augmenting existing commands. So that's all for v1.2

When v1.3 came, we all had to implement a new feature. Not realising that we can do whatever and not being confined to our old feature, I chose to add another minor property to my old feature I did in v1.2. Still no new feature, and I could have at least done some command such as sort. 

So at the end of the semester, I did quite trivial things, no new commands, nothing big. I tried to add a bit more to the docs to make up for this, but it still can't compare. Apparently I won't be penalised for this, because the tp is not graded based of LOC contributed. But still, it's so unsatisfying. 

Maybe a grander project could have been built if tp had been framed as `Utilize AB3 to build a software` instead of just `Expand on AB3`. It puts in perspective that the whole tp is about building a whole new software which can make use of AB3 features, instead of adding on some features to AB3 to make enhancements. But it is not the fault of the module that I did not interpret the goal correctly. 

But I can't blame all these feelings I have right now on anyone but myself. I'm not even sure if this is an appropriate place to write this, but I really want to write this somewhere.

Hi all, my group was intending on using reference frames within our sequence diagrams to avoid a situation where the diagram is too cluttered and messy. However, we were wondering how we should represent the creation of a class object within a reference frame. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85006125/138843916-c695d146-48aa-47a1-b5a7-4f8ec887d107.png)

For example, in the above picture, an instance of CreateGroupCommand is created within the reference frame (AweParser creates a CreateGroupCommandParser which creates a CreateGroupCommand so we want to leave these Low level details in a reference frame). A method from the CreateGroupCommand is subsequently called which is why it needs to be shown in this sequence diagram. Any help will be appreciated. Thank you very much.

I am working on Microsoft Windows 10 Home. Prior to submission of the iP, I created a JAR file using shadowJar.
I made sure to test it out myself using Java 11 (as seen below) and sent it to two friends who said that it worked perfectly on their laptops(one mac user and one windows user).

However, today I received an email from the CS2103 Teaching Team of LinkageErrors plaguing my JAR files upon running.

On Windows, using Java 11, for the Duke.Productivity.Tool.jar uploaded on 09-17-2021 (MM-DD-YYYY) at 14:13:14:
```Error: LinkageError occurred while loading main class duke.Launcher java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: duke/Launcher has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 57.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 55.0```
On Linux, using Java 11, for the Duke.Productivity.Tool.jar uploaded on 09-17-2021 (MM-DD-YYYY) at 14:13:14:
```Error: LinkageError occurred while loading main class duke.Launcher java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: duke/Launcher has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 57.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 55.0```
On Mac, using Java 11, for the Duke.Productivity.Tool.jar uploaded on 09-17-2021 (MM-DD-YYYY) at 14:13:14:

Upon closer inspection, my JAR file and Gradle runs the application without any issues, however, when I hit the play button in my Launcher class, they give me the errors as stated above. This is odd as my Build.Gradle file specifies that the Launcher class be executed when I do the run task. My launcher class comprises of a mere 3 lines and given that everything else works, I am unsure of how to resolve this issue. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thank you very much!

```
public class Launcher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Application.launch(Main.class, args);
    }
}
```

Noticed that @jianoway faced this issue before but managed to solve it on his/her own. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thank you very much!

I would like to clarify if we are expected to formally give credit to SE-EDU as shown in the [Policy on reuse](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/admin/appendixB-policies.html#policy-reuse) or will a simple "solution below adapted from ..." suffice?

Yes it is alright. You can take a closer look at the iP grading [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/admin/ip-grading.html) but essentially it states that "Requirements marked as optional or if-applicable are not counted when calculating the percentage of deliverables."

Thank you very much for the help Prof @damithc! For anyone who's facing similar issues in the future, setting the JAVA_HOME variable to point to the JDK 11 folder as prof suggested and Issue [#226](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/226) helped me to resolve this issue. I ran the clean task as well as shadowJar once more to create a new Jar file.

As the smoke tests are conducted only once per student prior to submission, may I trouble you to help me run the attached Jar file and see if all is well?

My understanding of the diff btw exception and assertion is that exception is triggered by a user mistake but the assertion by a programmer mistake? So for some potentially programmer-induced mistake, if you have used exception, can consider use assertion instead? 

> * The raising of an exception indicates an unusual condition created by the user (e.g. user inputs an unacceptable input) or the environment (e.g., a file needed for the program is missing).
> * An assertion failure indicates the programmer made a mistake in the code (e.g., a null value is returned from a method that is not supposed to return null under any circumstances).

For some reasons my Intellij stuck at Step 2.1 which is to create module from existing sources. So, If your Intellij happens to stuck at Step 2.1 of this [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/junit.html) as well, you can create a new module instead of creating from existing sources. Just delete the `src` within test folder after you have created the module and follow from Step 3 onwards.

Another note is that if the dummy test does not compile, go to Project Structure -&gt; Modules -&gt; Dependency and set junit to compile as shown here.

## Issue
I merged the `add-gradle-support` branch and following the steps as described here under scenario 2. Tried running some of the tasks on the Intellij interface and most of the tasks worked (except runShadow for some reason, and the ones that require checkstyle.xml to run)

> These tasks work

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38873431/131248683-496af658-e965-4df0-a6d5-178689974812.png)

I then tried running `gradlew clean` from the command line, and encountered this exception:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38873431/131248849-a2eecf81-0714-42e8-bca7-4962aa98878a.png)

And any follow up attempts to run `gradlew clean` again hits me with this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38873431/131248877-3691d183-df1e-420c-9742-0a8c594db021.png)

Weirdly enough, running clean from the Intellij GUI works, so I have no idea what's going on.

Here is gradle version:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38873431/131249117-1de48965-8661-45d6-8c31-427efe59dff9.png)

SDK version: 11.0.9

## Steps to recreate
### following the [tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html#using-gradle-to-do-some-common-project-activities) scenario 2.

1. Merge `add-gradle-support` into main
2. Close the project
3. Delete .idea folder in project root
4. Let project rebuild after restarting
5. File > Invalidate Caches / Restart > INVALIDATE CACHE AND RESTART
6. Update build.gradle's application mainClassName 
```java
application {
    mainClassName = "duke.Duke"
}
```
7. Build project
8. Use windows command prompt and navigate to project root
9. run command `gradlew clean`

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: Intellij indentation configuration for switch statements**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/71" expanded>

Regarding the java style guide as laid out here: https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.htm

It is stated that
```
 The switch statement should have the following form: Note there is no indentation for case clauses.
 Configure your IDE to follow this style instead.
```

```java
switch (condition) {
case ABC:
    statements;
    // Fallthrough
case DEF:
    statements;
    break;
case XYZ:
    statements;
    break;
default:
    statements;
    break;
}
```

This is not the default indentation behavior of the Intellij IDE, and upon checking the settings, I couldn't find a way to configure the indentation rules such that it will follow this style. 

Does anyone know of a way to configure the settings such that the above style is followed?

Hi, just to clarify, upon implementing level 4 which is support for the 3 different task types, can we drop support for adding a generic task (i.e. tasks added without being preceded by any keywords such as "todo", "deadline", and "event"), or should we continue to allow users to add such generic tasks? 

```
read book
    ____________________________________________________________

     added: read book
    ____________________________________________________________
```


If we continue to support adding of generic tasks, this will conflict with the example as seen in the error handling, 
```
blah
    ____________________________________________________________

     ☹ OOPS!!! I'm sorry, but I don't know what that means :-(
    ____________________________________________________________
```
Here "blah" would have been interpreted as just another generic task if we continued to support adding of generic tasks.

Good spot! Turns out it runs on the ide because the ide is configured to use the 11.0.9 jdk, but from the command line uses the default jdk on the system which is the 16.0.2 version. Gradle 6.2 does not support the newer jdks, so it doesn't build correctly.

Thanks for the help.

I just came to realise that my IP JAR file will have different GUI behaviors on others' PC than mine. 
Mine works just fine as shown:

Hi @samuelfangjw Senior! Thank you for checking in with me! Yes with help from @Chang-CH, he spotted an erroneous line from the `DialogBox `Class: 
`this.setPrefHeight(dialog.getMaxHeight());`
After we remove this line, the code seems to perform consistently across machines.
But we are still thinking what could be the possible causes of this inconsistent behaviours from different PC and that is why I have not made an update here. 
My guess is that the `this` is interpreted differently at different machines as either the `DialogBox` or the `Vbox`. For the former, it simply sets the `preHeight` of the `DialogBox`  to be `MaxHeight` of the `Label` text, whereas for the latter, the entire `Vbox` is changed and therefore causes all the messages to stack up in the shrunk space of `Vbox`. 
However, even if this is the case, I am not exactly certain of what could be the trigger of this issue on different machines. 
What do you think of the explanations and the causes Samuel? 😄

Hi, I am trying to implement undo for more than 1 task, using a stack<TaskList> or linkedlist<TaskList>. 
However, it seems like whenever I push a TaskList into the stack, all of the elements change to the one that I am pushing. 
Referencing https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45008792/listt-add-changes-everything-in-list , where it says that stacks and linkedlists hold pointers, I have tried to create new TaskLists, but this still does not solve the issue.

```java
private void commandUndo() throws LebronException {
        try {
            this.previousStates.pop();
            storage.saveToFile(getLatestState()); //getLatestState just peeks at the top of stack
        } catch (EmptyStackException e) {
            throw new LebronException("    OOPS! I have no memory of your last action! Try doing something first!");
        }
    }
```

My done method (the other commands follow similar structure)
```java
private String commandDone(String[] splitWords) throws LebronException {
        try {
            int pos = Integer.parseInt(splitWords[1]);
            TaskList newTaskList = getLatestState().getCopy(getLatestState());
            Task task = getLatestState().markDone(pos - 1);
            previousStates.push(newTaskList);
            storage.saveToFile(getLatestState());
            return ui.replyMarkDone(task);
        }

What I did was I printed out the bye message, and then used Java's Timer class to set a delay on the Platform.exit() command. That way you can have the bye message be visible to the user for as long you wish before closing the application.

Just to confirm, we are allowed to have multiple tags tagged to a single commit right? 

For example can we have both `Level-3` and `A-Classes` tagged to commit `aabbcc1`? Or must each commit only have 1 tag?

I think at this point its just semi-automated testing in the sense that you can run one command and it will tell you whether the outputs match or not instead of you manually having to type out all those lines of commands individually and manually checking whether the outputs are correct. For reference, if everything works out and the outputs match the following should be printed onto your screen:

The automated testing that you are referring to requires some testing frameworks like JUnit which is part of [week 3](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/schedule/week3/project.html) requirements under `A-JUnit`.

To add on, if you are sure that your `ACTUAL.txt` and `EXPECTED.txt` only differs because of trailing spaces or due to some UNIX vs Windows formatting issue, one way to "copy EXACTLY" is by using the command `cp ACTUAL.txt EXPECTED.txt`. I faced similar issues and this worked for me.

One possible way to do it is by overriding the `toString()` method of `Event`, `ToDo` and `Deadline` to return the formatted outputs and then looping through and printing out each of the task in your `List&gt;Task>`.

I don't think that there is really any hard rule that says when you should commit but generally the rule of thumb is that you should commit per logical change and commits should be rather atomic. One reason why you should keep your commits rather short is because it is easier to explain what you did in your commit messages which makes it clear for people to know exactly what each commit is for. If you only commit at the end of the day, chances are you have made changes to multiple things in your project and people will have to read through the changes to actually figure out what has changed instead of just reading the commit message header. I think that [this article](https://medium.com/@asifnahian/git-how-often-should-you-commit-c133e5473d76) summarizes this issue quite well!

Hi Prof,

Are we allowed to add command validation if it was reported as a bug by our tester in PE-D?

e.g. The tester reported that "next back back" or "month year day" are treated as valid "next" and "month" commands respectively even though the full string is not valid. So can we change command validation such that "next back back" or "month year day" will be considered invalid?

Thank you!

There was an issue reported about the font's not displaying properly for some Mac users, although it was mostly fixed, the help screen still has an issue. Reference to issue here: #66.

The issue with the help window is that the HelpWindow.fxml file does not initialize the CSS file required and hence I think goes with the default base font. I have fixed this issue by making a few changes to the FXML and the DarkTheme.css files.

I have attached the modified files. replace the original with them and also install the attached font  and it should fix the font issues.

As pointed out there will be an issue if files are packaged since javac doesn't look for files recursively. 

To solve that issue you need to make these changes:

**For Mac OS/Linux**:
```sh
# compile the code into the bin folder, terminates if error occurred
find ../src/main/java/*/*.java  > sources.txt

if ! javac -cp ../src/main/java -Xlint:none -d ../bin @sources.txt
then
    echo "********** BUILD FAILURE **********"
    exit 1
fi
```

**For Windows**:
```bat
REM compile the code into the bin folder
dir /s /B  ../src/main/java/*/*.java > sources.txt
javac  -cp ..\src\main\java -Xlint:none -d ..\bin @sources.txt
IF ERRORLEVEL 1 (
    echo ********** BUILD FAILURE **********
    exit /b 1
)
```

The original solution was actually intended for those who are running the application from IntelliJ. 

For those using the jar file. You will need to add the three included font files into the Mac's FontBook and ensure that it's added under computer (for all users). Then you can run the included jar file.

A follow up @damithc, for something similiar. Is it considered a feature if different tag types were already there and used in v1.3 and if the UI just gives different colors in the v1.4.

Hello,

I am planning to use a font called [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) for my iP project. On the website, under FAQ > Usage, the author said that he'd "appreciate it if you referred others to this web site rather than serving the font files from elsewhere". Would a line in the `Readme` file crediting the author of the font suffice? Since a font is not a 3rd party library, do I have to submit a third party request to use the font?

Hi guys,

If you guys are a confused on the instructions to add your organisation's fork to CodeCov:

1. Sign up to CodeCov
2. Enable Github Actions on your fork
3. Make a trivial commit to your fork (This runs the CI/CD workflow which uploads a report to CodeCov)
4. CodeCov should have detected your fork!

I took a embarrassing amount of time figuring this out. So hopefully this useful to some of you :)

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: 💡  Improving the Checkstyle Rules File**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/136" expanded>

I've used the checkstyle.xml file provided by SE-EDU but have noticed some of the configured rules are either overly strict or aren't fully in line with their stated conventions.

I've taken an attempt at modifying the rules file and made the following changes:

**1. Allow abbreviations for constants (final variables)**
```Java
final int COLOR_RED;  // Now will not produce abbreviation error
```
**2. Disable end-of-line operatorWrap checks**
```Java
int number = reallyLongFunctionName()
            + anotherFunctionName();  //No OperatorWrap error, might be needed to break long lines of code
```
**3. Modified CustomImportOrder** 
Original import sequence
```Java
import java.util.ArrayList; //Standard imports
import java.util.List;

import org.abc.module; //Followed by imports starting with "org"

import com.abc.module; //Then imports starting with "com"

import duke.Ui; //Followed by every other import clumped together
import javafx.scene.control.ScrollPane;
import javafx.scene.control.TextField;
```
New import sequence
```Java
import java.util.ArrayList; //Standard imports
import java.util.List;

import javafx.scene.control.ScrollPane; //Third-party imports
import javafx.scene.control.TextField;

import duke.Ui; //Duke imports
```

I'm not sure if I'm unknowingly breaking any of the stated conventions, so let me know if I am 😃 .
If not, feel free to [try out the configuration yourselves](https://github.com/bryanwee023/ip/blob/f0c31c453f125fa647734cc8339490b84133fcb9/config/checkstyle.xml)! Let me know if there are bugs or more edits that can be made.

Hi guys, just my 2 cents.

I mostly agree with @pss-coder argument. However, I think exceptions should not always be checked by the client. This could break the spirit of encapsulation. As a client of a package, I am not expected to know the constructor's logic or why errors are thrown. 

Hence, in cases where possible exceptions are closely coupled to logic unimportant to the client, exception checking can be handled by a factory method, as suggested by @yucheng11122017.

Although, I wonder if using factory methods for trivial cases could unnecessarily fatten the interface. I mean it's also not common to find Java classes with constructors that throw exceptions (e.g. `java.io.File`) 🤷 .

I think that deciding on whether the enumeration should be implemented as an inner class should not be dependent on how many classes uses it. Instead it should be dependent on what it describes.

It would only make sense to use an inner enum class if the enumeration **specifically** describes a trait of the class.

There can be cases where enums are utilised by multiple classes but are implemented as an inner class.
```java
class Robot {
    public enum Status { IDLE, RUNNING, CHARGING };  //Other classes can access the status of the robot.
    public Status stat;
}
```

I ran into this similar issue earlier and what worked for me was to manually write down all the import statements in the file that has the `public static void main(String[] args)` function.

ie instead of:
```
import main.java.*;
```

do:
```
import main.java.Engine;
import main.java.Task;
...
```

There shouldn't be any need to edit the original .bat file, unless your Java's version is different from IntelliJ's java version. In that case, it is an issue with PATH instead.

Hey Yu Cheng, have you perhaps tried running the jar file to see if the application runs? 11 thousand KB translates to 11MB, which is what Prof Damith mentioned the file size should be and is around the size for my file too.

Hi Rama, could you try removing the static from the method names? Since the method is currently greyed out which means the method is not being used. I tried replicating your issue and I got the same error when I used static for my methods too.

Think it would have been just an association line without arrows as the question did not hint as to how the Person-Inbox relationship is implemented. For example, it could be that the Inbox strictly holds only 1 Person reference in it's implementation while Person has no reference to Inbox at all, which would suggest navigability from Inbox to Person as opposed to Person to Inbox (as counter-intuitive as it may sound). This would still satisfy the requirement of "A Person's Inbox". But since such a scenario was not presented, the information regarding navigability is not present so my take would be that it would still be an association line without arrows.

Could be wrong but please feel free to add on!

Hi, my team wanted to check what this course's stance is on the EXPLICIT mention of access modifiers.

Back in CS2030s we were marked down if the access modifiers were not explicitly stated as for the most part we were only expected to use ```private``` or ```public``` access modifiers. 

In this module, since we are dealing with packages, we wanted to check if it would be okay to not have an access modifier to connote that a field is package-private, or are we encouraged to use the ```protected``` which is the closest to package-private also gives the field access to subclasses, as it is explicitly mentioned.

From my understanding of Java, and the check style, Java recommends using `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for static final constants.

On the other hand, many documents, and the check style we are using recommends `camelCase` for naming non-static final variables. 

The SE-EDU website however recommends `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for non-static final variables.

When Executing into the gradle task, some would get the error `Could not find or load main class seedu.duke.Duke`. In order to fix this, there would have to mention the package of your Duke class in the build.gradle file.

In this file, the main class name has to be changed from 
```gradle
application {
    mainClassName = "seedu.duke.Duke"
}
```

to 

```gradle
application {
    mainClassName = "duke.Duke"

```
or the package of your main duke class.

I'm guessing this is because your Duke class takes in a String parameter as an argument. 

One solution is to overload the Duke class with a constructor that requires no parameters. 

If you would want to use your Duke constructor which takes in a parameter, you can refer to the third solution with 8 upvotes in the link [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24611789/how-to-pass-parameters-to-javafx-application).

I have prepared my input.txt file with multiple lines of inputs. However, when I run the .bat file, it only takes in the first line. 

Here's my "input.txt" file:
```text
todo borrow book
list
deadline return book /by sunday
event project meeting /at Mon 2-4pm
list
bye
```

This is my "actual.txt" file created:
```text
 ____        _        
|  _ \ _   _| | _____ 
| | | | | | | |/ / _ \
| |_| | |_| |   <  __/
|____/ \__,_|_|\_\___|

___________________________________________
Hello! I'm Duke
What can I do for you?
___________________________________________
___________________________________________
Got it. I've added this task:
	[T][ ] borrow book
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
___________________________________________
```

Am I doing something wrong with the I/O redirection technique such that it only takes in the first line of input? Also, according to the recorded lecture video on testing, the "actual.txt" shows that input by the user but mine does not. Is that also normal?

Thanks!

Ah. It works now. Thanks for your help! Didn't realize it is the same issue as the issue that you directed me to due to the title naming.

I am unable to run my Duke after I have made the following changes according to the guide:

into my ``build.gradle`` as seen from https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#gradle
but it shows this error:

you need to add these two files in the following location

Yes, simply delete the tag and then reassign it to the new commit. 

1. If the tag has been pushed to remote repository, run 'git push origin --delete tagname' to delete the tag in the remote. 
2. Then you can do 'git tag -d tagname' which deletes the tag on your local repo. 
3. Assign the tag to the correct commit-id using 'git tag tagname commitId' 
4. Then you can push your reassigned tags to the remote repo with 'git push --tags'

I'm assuming you're referring to the text-ui-test's bat file. 
With additional packages, you can just leave it as: `javac  -cp ..\src\main\java -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\*.java`
and it will still work. 

Hope this helps!

I think a potential place to avoid assertions for would be for public method arguments (since assertions can be disabled, it can cause erroneous results when assertions are turned off).

Another place is to avoid assertions to perform work that the application needs for correct operation.

A more in-depth explanation can be found on the Oracle docs under the 'Putting Assertions Into Your Code' section.

I believe your computer ran the software from a different directory. Suppose you:
1. Put your `Duke.jar` on Desktop
2. Open Terminal where the directory is at `~`
3. Run `java -jar Desktop/Duke.jar`
The data folder/file will be created at `~` instead of `Desktop`.

I think something similar might have happened when you double click the jar file. You could perhaps check you home directory?

Could also consider `ls -a` to see the folder is somehow hidden.

According to the textbook: https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/specifyingRequirements.html#use-cases, use cases when referenced in other use cases should be underlined. However, markdown does not natively support underlining as underlining is generally used for links.

Should we use HTML to underline use cases when they are referenced, or should we adopt our own convention?

I think the root cause of this issue is because of one of my teammates updating the gradle.yml file but the personal access token used by SourceTree does not allow editing of GitHub workflows. However, I am facing difficulties updating the personal access token.  
Following the answer on this link : [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64059610/how-to-resolve-refusing-to-allow-an-oauth-app-to-create-or-update-workflow-on](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64059610/how-to-resolve-refusing-to-allow-an-oauth-app-to-create-or-update-workflow-on), I do not see any PATs listed for me to edit, and I am having trouble trying to change the PAT used by SourceTree (or even the underlying Git for Windows credentials).

I followed the guide to create my jar file and the jar file was successfully created, but when i try to run it (both in IntelliJ and using `java -jar iP.jar` i get the error message:

Error: Invalid or corrupt jar file iP.jar

I have tried running the program in IntelliJ terminal and it works so I think the problem occurs when creating the jar file.

Edit: Running the program through IntelliJ and not the terminal (like right clicking Duke and doing run Duke.main()) results in an error saying "could not find or load main class duke.Duke". I suspect its a problem with how the project is packaged but don't know what the issue is

Like @xlzior mentioned, fast-forwarding makes your git history cleaner, and in a way prevents unnecessary commits. In the context of this module, I think the main disadvantage would be because when looking at the Git history, fast-forwarded merges won't look like separate branches, making it more difficult for us and the teaching team to track our changes.

For week 3 i think we are supposed to follow a workflow as follows:
do changes in 7, do changes in 8, go to master, merge 7, tag 7, merge 8, tag 8, push master push branches push tags
but i did something along the lines of:
changes in 7, push to branch 7, changes in 8, push to branch 8, go to master merge 7 and 8, push master, push tags.
is this considered acceptable and if not how am i supposed to undo it (or do it correctly)?

I was updating test cases for storage, which passed on my Windows machine, but when I pushed to Github, the workflow run failed due to `NullPointerException` for MacOS, but not for Windows or Ubuntu. None of my team members own a Mac. How do I even resolve such an issue? [See here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/runs/4125930672?check_suite_focus=true)

This is the line producing the `NullPointerException`:
`jsonAddressBookStorage.saveAddressBook(original, filePath);`

I think assertions are important in helping software engineers like us to find bugs in the project that can occur due to our own mistake. Even if there are no errors now, some changes in the future might introduce new errors (regression bugs).

Use assertions to validate invariants, which are conditions that will always be the same regardless of the input, when the method is called and other states of the program.

However, assertions should not be used when you would expect some other exceptions to be thrown, such as when the user inputs the wrong command.

See more [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/assert.html).

Hi Prof, that was an old test that already existed in the original AB3. My changes were indeed too big to locate the exact problem.

Anyways, I found a few more bugs with regards to other parts of my project and somehow, the MacOS workflow succeeded. The mystery still remains.. why MacOS?

I have also tried removing all keychains regarding GitHub under keychain access before re-adding my account into SourceTree as mentioned in this thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15381198/remove-credentials-from-git but the same problem occurred again.

Would really appreciate any advice, thanks in advance!

<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: TreeWalker as parent of LineLength error**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/163" expanded>

Details:
> "TreeWalker is not allowed as a parent of LineLength Please review 'Parent Module' section for this Check in web documentation if Check is standard." - intellij error message
- Reference doc: [github forum](https://github.com/jshiell/checkstyle-idea/issues/458)
- So I know the issue (_TreeWalker component shouldnt be parent of LineLength component_) but I'm quite tentative to change it cos I don't think we're suppose to change the checkstyle.xml, just import it wholesale? Also, if I was to change it, I also don't know what to change it to 😢 

Context:
- just setup Gradle and copied over .xml checkstyle
- was using JDK 15, now swapped back to JDK 11
- Gradle run, build works (if I comment out `id 'checkstyle'` & the checkstyle block)
- I had a previous issue with _unable to Instantiate FileContentHolder_ error but followed [link](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/5132) to just comment out the message. Supposedly, its due to the upgraded version of checkstyle.

Relevant Code:
```xml
<module name="TreeWalker">

&gt;!-- Required for SuppressionCommentFilter to work -->
&gt;!--    <module name="FileContentsHolder"/>-->

... other code

    <module name="LineLength">
      &gt;!-- Checks if a line is too long. -->
      <property name="max" value="120"/>

Hi Han Ming, thanks for the advice :)

Agreed that I shouldn't be too worried on having to change files, but was concerned cos no one else reported this issue although everyone should have copied over the exact same checkstyle file. So in all likelihood the problem is me.

Anyhow faced a few issues before this and commented them out as per some stackoverflow comments. After shifting the LineLength up i faced yet another 4/5 issued on deprecated properties and I kinda give up commenting them out (cos who knows how many more there are). 

Will probably leave out the checkstyle now and come back to it later if I have time, thanks for the advice nonetheless.
If anyone knows how to get it to work without changing the code please lemme know :).

Actually along this thought, we should also try to exit javafx cleanly (disable textfield and button, set textfield text to "exiting..." to indicate the disabled textfield and button is not a bug, and disable the enter key from doing anything after user sent bye command, otherwise unintended behaviour may occur.

@damithc 
I have completed all deliverables for the iP on time. But now I wish to perform some major refactoring to the iP codebase. For instance, apply more OOP, add more tests, add features. According to the extract from module website below, these changes "can be done after the semester is over". Does this imply that I have to wait until the semester is done before I can do any major changes? Or can we proceed to make the changes anytime thanks to the power of version control?

Also a recent email from the teaching team says we can make another release in Week 7. What are the limitations/constraints on this release (e.g. limited to bug fixes, etc.) ?

If I reuse a piece of code from another current student, I have to credit them. Makes sense, Fair enough.
But can I confirm that in the credit format according to the following article found in the Admin section of the module website, the _{yourGithubUsername}_ stands for the GitHub username of the source and not me (the person reusing it)?

Leaving this here because I initially thought it was a strange bug in the checkstyle file, in case anyone faces the same issue:

Depending on your settings, Intellij might automatically add some indentation when you hit enter to create a blank line. This will be picked up by checkstyle as trailing whitespace, but the intellij settings wouldnt allow you to have a blank line without having the indent.

For example:
```java
foo() {
    ...
} // line a

bar() {
...
```
The line after a will be automatically indented, which causes a trailing whitespace error to be picked up, but when you go to that line and hit backspace it clears the whole line and you no longer have a space between foo and bar.

To disable this feature just go to preferences -&gt; editor -&gt; general -&gt; smart keys and set `unindent on backspace` to `to nearest indent position`

Hi, I've faced the same problem as you. I found [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15723240/java-whats-the-difference-of-double-clicking-and-running-from-terminal-for-op). I actually tried troubleshooting but if i recall correctly the only solution that worked (file found for both double click and command line) was to make it such that the file to read from / write to is in the user's home dir and nowhere else, which in my opinion isn't really much of a fix... 

I personally still haven't found a solution to this and now my jar wont run on double click at all so thats another thing i have to fix

Hey, after managing to locate the file created from double click were you able to make it such that double click ran the same way as running from the terminal? if so how did you do it?

Edit: (For anyone still monitoring this thread) I managed to get it to work by giving the java launcher full disk access, you can find out how to do so in [this](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252709578) post. 

Essentially the jar has restricted disk read / write permissions when running on double click, so it cant create anything but a temporary file in the middle of nowhere. On the other hand running via terminal gives the jar permission to read / write since it is 'piggybacking' on the permissions that the terminal has as well. Changing permissions of the java launcher removes this need for piggybacking.

In week 4's ip instructions, there was no explicit requirement to branch out, so I did all my changes on the main branch. The ip dashboard shows all tags except the branch-Level-10 tag. 

Is this alright or do I need to create a branch-Level-10 branch (and merge it) just for show?

Yes this is the case for me as well. It shows red due to being a new file that isn't staged in git.

Hi, I managed to find the problem. Apparently I was running the tests under my 'test' module instead of my root module.

A small pop up appears briefly upon running the tests each time, and clicking on it has allowed the tests to be run under the root module and solved my problem.

Thank you!

Hi Allard,
You are correct to say that the attribute name and object names are two different things but I think it is correct because we can give the object any name we want since it is not specified anywhere in the code, including using `spanner` again.
This is also why `s: StockItem` is also accepted. I think object names when not specified can be left blank (optional) or be given any arbitrary name.

Hope this helps!

I personally feel that prefixing `get` in your case here may be a bit misleading since we usually associate `getX` with getters, which are methods returning field `X` from the instance.

Since you are kind of formatting a string in the method, I think that using "format" as the verb here would be appropriate. 

Additionally, `outOfBoundsString` sounds like it is the string that is out-of-bounds, but actually it is the `index` that is out-of-bounds.

I would suggest `formatIndexOutOfBoundsString`, but since the strings are actually messages to be displayed to the user, how about `formatIndexOutOfBoundsMessage`?

Oh okay I understand, so for this I will have to name it as STORAGE as the storage object stored in this will always be the same for that class. Thank you!

If you followed [this guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html) to install your checkstyle, you may have downloaded the checkstyle from [Address Book Level 3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle)

It seems that incheckstyle version 8.45, the module _JavadocMethod_ no longer has the property of `scope`. Instead, it is now called `accessModifiers`. This only occurs once in the checkstyle.xml at line 387

Once changed, you should be able to add your checkstyle to Intelij.

I cloned your repo and managed to create a jar file. Did you follow the instruction from [here ](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/jar.html)as well?

Here are the steps that I took.
1. I made the 'java' folder the sources "Sources Roor"
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39267610/131008451-37a183c2-97d5-4c19-aefa-48da99db15eb.png)

2. I went to _File_ > _Project Structure_ > _Artifacts_. Then, I clicked on the _+_ > _JAR_ > _From modules with dependencies..._

3. I clicked on this button
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39267610/131008842-dcb2b2dd-ce6c-436e-8425-996485d756f0.png)

4. I selected _Duke (duke)_ and click _Ok_
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39267610/131008939-97dc68c3-3905-47c8-b028-9ee521e40b37.png)

5. I clicked _Ok_ a few more times

6. A MANIFEST.MF file is created in the project
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39267610/131009155-3f3ea3d0-1ad8-42ad-ba5c-818f8ad1c1f2.png)

7. I click _Build_ > _Build Artifects_ > _Build_

8. The JAR file is found at _ip/out/artifacts/Test_jar/Test.jar_

Hope this helps!

Hi everyone,

For the tp, our team is failing CI due to a "no newline at EOF" error for our json files.

We're not sure why this error is happening.
Firstly, line 18 is not the last line of this file. 
Secondly, we already have a new line after the last line of our file.

They didn't give any info about the error, so I was confused for a while, but here is the fix:

Change in `MainWindow.fxml`:

I'm going to close the issue. The issue was that I was using Java SDK 15, which is incompatible with gradle 6.2. The project settings strangely does not affect the Terminal's java version. You have to point the environment PATH variable in Settings > Terminal > Environment variables to the correct Java SDK version for this to work.

Basically, @jackgugz had the `dialog` label set to a max height of 1.7976931348623157E308 in the [fxml file](https://github.com/jackgugz/ip/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/DialogBox.fxml). `this.setPrefHeight(dialog.getMaxHeight())` set the preferred height of `DialogBox` to that value. The compatibility issue was likely due to the behavior of `prefHeight`.

@VimuthM Thank you for your suggestion but it seems that editing the ```Path``` isn't enough to solve the problem in my case.
After following your recommended post, I found another [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22381202/a-jni-error-has-occurred-please-check-your-installation-and-try-again-in-eclips) and uninstalled Java JRE 8 [manually from the Control Panel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uninstall-or-remove-apps-and-programs-in-windows-10-4b55f974-2cc6-2d2b-d092-5905080eaf98), restarted my computer, then it worked :D So, as long as ```java -version``` and ```javac -version``` give the same version, the problem is solved.

I was adding Gradle support and added the `add-gradle-support` branch. Then I couldnt push it using SourceTree because "Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind", even though there shouldn't be any updates. I merged back to master and pushed but SourceTree still did not allow me to do so. Then, I do not know what I did, but I managed to push it. But it got pushed to the original iP repository by Prof Damith, and it wasn't pushed to my forked repository.

This is how my SourceTree look like now.

Hello, I need some help regarding generating a new JAR file for this week's iP.

I referred to the Gradle tutorial that was linked in the description of the task. I tried to delete the `'.idea` file and ran `shadow jar` multiple times. Still, my `.jar` is &gt; 10MB. It runs as expected on my machine but I feel it probably won't on someone else's system if they dont have `javafx`.

Hello, if you are worried about the readability in the switch statement, wrapping everything into a method to handle that particular case would be very useful. For example, for case Done command, I would have a one-liner handleDone(..) method. 
Others reading your code will be able to easily understand the purpose of the switch at a glance, and refer to the method if they need to see the implementation.

At this current point in our chat bot, we handle exceptions by printing a custom message and continue accepting input. 

Given that the way of handling exceptions is the same for all DukeExceptions, is there any added benefit to creating multiple specific exceptions (e.g. TaskIndexOutOfBoundsException or MissingParamsException) that extend DukeExceptions? On the other hand, is passing the string to be printed as argument through DukeException more scalable? (Since there wouldn't be a need to create new Exception classes each time we implement a new feature)

It doesn't really matter when you push as what you are doing when you push is just updating the copy on GitHub with your local copy. And yep, when you do a `git push` you are pushing to your remote branch on GitHub (you can check which branch you are on using `git status`).

My 2 🪙 :  
Merge conflicts will be inevitable in a branching workflow. However, I believe there are ways to minimise them:
1. Good code design and separation of concerns. UI and data storage shouldn't be mangled together, for example. You can split features into various modules, and have each member work on their own modules without having to worry too much about conflicts.
2. Planning and management of project. Plan ahead and assign distinct tasks to each member, with the goal of minimising the dependency/interconnectedness of separate tasks/issues.
3. Good development practices such as clear communication between members. Everyone should have some idea what the others are doing. This is one reason for regular scheduled meetings where everyone can discuss and see what others are working on. If 2 or more people need to work on similar parts of the code, they should communicate between themselves to ensure minimal conflicts.
4. PRs should be small and focused as much as possible. Generally speaking, if your PR is getting too big (>1k LoC for example), you may want to take a step back and figure out if you can split this up into smaller PRs that are more targeted. Don't try to introduce many, unrelated changes into one PR that affects code from all over the codebase. Furthermore, smaller and more focused PRs are easier to follow and reason about, and hence easier to review.

What I described above is an ideal scenario. Of course, there are times where nasty conflicts are inevitable, such as major refactoring where you are moving files about or modifying files all over the codebase as part of the refactoring. However, those cases are (hopefully) more rare, and a heads up should be given to the whole team when such a major change is happening so that they won't be caught off guard.

Regarding,
> Should B pull from remote to check for updates in master? Or just concentrate and finish their work?

Personally, I will `pull` frequently. Changes made in `master` should be (mostly) finalised, so no matter how long you delay fixing the merge conflicts, you will still have to fix them when you make ur PR. The problem with putting it off is if you are not updated on what's happening in master, you may diverge even further and create even more conflicts unknowingly, leaving you with a massive mess and headache at the very end. So to avoid 'fun' surprises (especially before deadlines), I will lean towards resolving conflicts ASAP.

> If B should pull, what if B only wants to pick some changes from the updated master, not everything?

I believe you can use `git cherry-pick` to do that, although I will personally just pull all the changes (for reason mentioned above).

The week 6 project tasks page mentioned that even if the file format wasn't `png`, still name it `png`. I thought that this meant that the file could be in any file format I wanted so long as it was still named `Ui.png`. So I tried making it a `gif` file and it worked (it still shows up in the IP showcase page with no issues) so I kept it as a `gif` file.
![Jay's IP GUI](https://jayasting98.github.io/ip/Ui.png)

I also tried to make the GUI kind of "responsive" by making the icons resize and eventually disappear when the app is resized until the width was too small.

I have a longer demo of it [here](https://jayasting98.github.io/ip/images/demo_responsive_ui.gif) or in my [user guide](https://jayasting98.github.io/ip/).

Since the GUI is specifically for Duke, and iP isn't going to require applying the GUI to different models in the same project, it would make sense to put the GUI classes into a supackage of `duke` like `duke.ui`?

I am not very sure but I think a tag cannot have the same name as another branch. I could not push my commit in a branch to remote because I have a tag of the same name in remote already, after deleting the tag I was able to push. Did you by any chance name one of your branch as Level-8?

Alternatively, you can include a Main.java as a driver class for Duke without making any changes to the runtest scripts.

How about creating an abstract class that extends from Task, and let it contain the Date and Time class fields and the compareTo method. Then let Deadline and Event extend from this new class? (Not sure if this is better, but this kinda reduces the "code duplication" problem)

Problem seems to lie in this [file](https://github.com/SajalVaishnav/ip/blob/master/src/main/java/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF).

Try changing the Main-Class to duke.Launcher as well? Not sure if you have to rebuild it.

Hi, maybe you can try running the suggested `--stacktrace` option to get more useful information.

A possible bug that I can think of is:
maybe the main class specified in `build.gradle` is different from your package name.
This happened to me and I couldn't run `checkstyleMain` and `run`.

<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: CLI vs GUI**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/197" expanded>

Now that we've implemented a GUI for Duke, should we be using the previous iteration of CLI for any testing / etc?

In my **build.gradle** file, my mainClassName is "duke.Launcher". I followed the instructions and included a main method in my Launcher class:

``` Java
public static void main(String[] args) {
        Application.launch(Duke.class, args);
    }
```

While the GUI works fine, when I want to test the CLI through my main method in ```Duke.java```, I get a ```Error: JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application```. 

Only upon changing my main method in the Launcher class to the following, does the CLI run: 

``` Java
public class Launcher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
//        Application.launch(Duke.class, args);
        Duke duke = new Duke("data/tasks.txt");
        duke.run();
    }
}
```

Is there a better way to simultaneously run the CLI and GUI? Or is this a wrong methodology altogether? Thank you!

```

The error message when I try to run the jar file is as follows:
